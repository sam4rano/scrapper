Photo by Green Thing Kenya, used with permission. This story was written by Bonface Orucho and originally published by Bird Story Agency on March 20, 2025. This revised version is republished below as part of a content-sharing agreement. Entering one of Nelly Gesare's eco-conscious retail stores in Kenya is like walking into a world in transformation. Glass bottles, once discarded as waste, are now sleek drinking tumblers and jars. Scraps of fabric, saved from landfills, have been stitched into desirable shopping bags and reusable dish sponges. Every shelf tells a story — not of waste but of renewal. This is now the world of the former journalist who has turned the challenge of waste into a thriving business. She explained in an interview with Bird Story Agency: I use Green Thing Kenya to tell the story of sustainability and the opportunities therein. My goal is to break down sustainability and show that it’s not just about the environment — it’s about a broader systemic shift. She added: We focus on eco-friendly home care, recycled materials, and sustainable textiles. Some of our work involves white-label manufacturing for other brands. White label manufacturing is when a product is produced by one party and sold to other retailers, who add their own labels and customization. Green Thing Kenya is one of a number of upcycling brands, including Ecandi, EcoSafi, MokoMaya, and others, that operate in Nairobi. The rise of eco-brands in the region signals a growing consumer preference for sustainable products, according to Cynthia Atieno, a sustainability expert at the United Nations Environment Programme. She explained: It is incredibly encouraging to see brands like Green Thing Kenya gaining market success. It reaffirms that sustainability is not just a trend but a thriving market with real demand and long-term potential. The trend is also in expansion mode, well beyond major cities like Nairobi. Dennis Ondari, a 26-year-old entrepreneur from Kisii town, who has been running a glass bottle waste business since December 2024, cites the rising demand for eco-friendly products as “the biggest motivator” behind launching his venture there. He explained in a phone interview: Before starting ‘Chupa Zone,’ I worked for an eco product business in Nairobi for three years. I witnessed the growth; that is why I decided to replicate the model here. However, Gesare revealed that when she began her venture a decade ago, she did not set out to be a sustainability entrepreneur. She noted: As a journalist, my primary goal was always to make information accessible and digestible — for both the general public and younger audiences. She added: Back in 2012, sustainability was still a very new concept. To raise awareness, I created a TV series and pitched it to media houses I had previously worked with. However, the challenge was that the content wasn’t being prioritized. That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. The journey was hardly uneventful. Her first business attempt included manufacturing reusable metallic straws, a venture that hit a roadblock when local production costs soared to an unsustainable 1,500 shillings (about USD 12) per straw. But instead of giving up, she found a new way forward. A turning point came. I lost everything. With the little I had left, I launched a product — and it sold out in two days. That experience showed me the power of sustainability-driven business. In a matter of years, Gesare has created not just an eco-brand for selling a range of products, but she has demonstrated that individuals can turn waste into thriving businesses. Hers is a model that not only helps clean up the environment but also empowers local communities. Sustainable home essentials from Green Thing Kenya. Photo by Green Thing Kenya. Used with permission. The company works with women waste pickers, offering them fair wages while dignifying their role in the circular economy. By formalizing waste collection and providing financial stability to these workers, Gesare is proving that sustainability solutions must also be people-centered. She noted: My strength has always been in identifying people — finding the right talent and creating opportunities for them. Today, Green Thing Kenya transforms discarded glass, fabric, and plastics into a diverse range of eco-friendly items, from biodegradable cleaning supplies to upcycled textiles like reusable dish sponges and makeup removers. The company also operates a solar-powered stitching station, ensuring that even the production process aligns with its sustainability ethos. Gesare noted: I have also recently set up a glass-blowing studio — the second of its kind in Kenya in 30 years, and the first ever owned by a Kenyan woman. While Gesara is defying the formidable hurdles that African entrepreneurs, especially women, encounter, not all women have the same opportunities. Many women in Africa face unique challenges from their male counterparts, from gender-based challenges in securing funding and social stigma, to entrenched gender roles and issues navigating global economic uncertainties. She noted: For many women in business, funding is often evaluated based on risk rather than potential. To this day, I have never received a grant. And yet, I’ve grown from a solo entrepreneur to employing more than ten full-time staff members. The funding challenges that women-led startups in Africa face are perhaps best captured in a 2023 report by the startup funding tracking organization, Africa: The Big Deal. Even though Africa has the highest rate of female entrepreneurship globally, according to the African Development Bank, in 2023, startups with solo or all-female founders secured just 2.3 percent of total African startup funding. This figure rises to 15 percent for teams with at least one female founder. A 2023 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that more than a quarter of all businesses were either started or run by women. By comparison, in Europe, entrepreneurial activity among women is just 5.7 percent, according to figures from the European Investment Bank. Entrepreneurs like Gesare highlight the resilience of African women in business. She said: I’m now diversifying my revenue streams through exports. As of this month, we’ve started exporting glass products. Research by Development Reimagined suggests that between 1994 and 2021, global trade in environmental goods grew significantly, yet the distribution remains highly imbalanced. While China dominates with 17.3 percent of global exports, Africa contributes only 1 percent, with South Africa accounting for over half of that share, suggesting that Africa has plenty of untapped opportunities in the trade of eco-products. Gesare’s product line serves as a testament to the viability of the industry domestically, with thousands of customers now choosing biodegradable material over plastic, proving that business can be both profitable and responsible. Green Thing Kenya’s current revenues are from three product categories: eco-friendly hotel products, eco-friendly home care products, and non-toxic cleaning products. Some of its most popular products, such as glassware, received an overwhelmingly positive market response. In its first month of operation, the company generated over KES 200,000 (more than USD 1,500 ) in glass product sales. Today, it processes more than 4,000 bottles each month. The company is now expanding beyond Kenya. Green Thing recently entered the export market, shipping glassware and eco-friendly home care products to international buyers. To sustain this growth, Gesare is collaborating with universities on cutting-edge sustainability research and investing in improved packaging to meet global standards. For aspiring green entrepreneurs, her message is clear: You have it in you to make it possible. When one thing doesn’t work, it’s often a redirection to explore what you can do with the resources available to you."
2,Are 90 percent of Kenyans homophobic?,https://globalvoices.org/2024/08/20/are-90-percent-of-kenyans-homophobic/,Ultra-conservative advocacy group CitizenGo circulated a petition with deceptive data claims,Linda Ngari,20 August 2024,"Screenshot from YouTube video, ‘LGBTQ Kenyans face backlash after rights group’s court win‘ by FRANCE 24 English. Fair use. This article was written by Linda Ngari with support from the Initiative for Equality and Non Discrimination (INEND) to monitor and debunk misinformation targeting Kenya's LGBTQ+ community online and offline. A Supreme Court of Kenya ruling meant to reaffirm the rights of queer Kenyans as guaranteed in the Constitution was ironically used to unleash unbalanced, politically-motivated homophobia, especially by the political class and right-wing lobby groups. The ruling that was made in February 2023 ended a decade-long court battle and allowed organizations advocating for LGBTQ+ rights to officially register under the NGO Coordination Board. However, it elicited unsettling homophobic rhetoric online and offline, with the major proponents of hate speech against queer Kenyans being political leaders. A motion tabled by Nyali Member of Parliament (MP) Mohamed Ali, claiming to protect “family values and the human race from going extinct,” resulted in Kenya's parliament passing a bill banning the discussion, publication, and dissemination of LGBTQ+ content in the country. The motion was unanimously passed in April 2023. Even after the February 2023 ruling, public outrage led to the case, initially presented in court in 2012, being reviewed by the Supreme Court in September 2023. Once again, the court upheld its stance in support of the freedom of association for LGBTQ+ organizations. Opposition to the ruling manifested both online and offline. On September 15, 2023, Mohamed Ali shared on X (formerly Twitter) that he had joined an anti-LGBTQ+ march in Momabasa. Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua also dismissed the Supreme Court ruling. However, one of the most notable oppositions came from Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma’s proposal to amend the Family Protection Bill of Kenya to include the criminalisation of LGBTQ+ relationships and ban comprehensive sexuality education. In support of Kaluma’s proposition, a right-wing organization called CitizenGo circulated a petition entitled, “I support the Family Protection bill of 2023 by Honorable Peter Kaluma.” The petition was started in April 2023 and has so far received over 4,000 signatures. It contains a claim alleging that a “recent” poll by marketing research company IPSOS supposedly revealed that 90 percent of Kenyans are allegedly opposed to homosexuality. To begin with, describing Peter Kaluma’s suggestions as a bill is misleading. The parliament of Kenya defines a bill as a draft law presented for debate. There is no mention of the Family Protection Bill on the Kenyan parliament’s bill tracker. Neither does the parliamentary Hansard contain any record of the Family Protection Bill having ever been discussed in parliament. To verify the claim that IPSOS, whose brand has previously been used to fabricate fake polls, conducted the data cited by CitizenGo, this author reached out to IPSOS. In response, IPSOS Kenya Managing Director Chris Githaiga issued a statement clarifying that IPSOS Kenya “has not conducted any polls on homosexuality or any related studies.” Moreover, a Google search of the sentence: “90 percent of Kenyans are opposed to homosexuality,” brings up an article published by The Guardian in 2015. The article shows that in 2013, which was 11 years ago, 90 percent of Kenyans were found to be against homosexuality. The article quotes a survey by American Pew Research Center, which is where the data as quoted by CitizenGo originates — not from IPSOS, as alleged. As a rule of thumb, research is considered stale and obsolete when it is more than 10 years old. This proves that the claim made by CitizenGo, allegedly quoting a “recent poll,” is from research done 11 years ago and, hence, obsolete. CitizenGO is a Spain-based organization founded by Ignacio Arsuaga, presenting itself as a community of active citizens dedicated to defending “family values.” The organization runs campaigns that especially align with right-wing ideologies, such as anti-choice campaigns, as well as banning and stopping the implementation of comprehensive sex education. Some of the success stories that CitizenGo boasts of under their victories webpage include their petition to protect Kenya's churches from taxation, another petition to ban Tiktok in Kenya for sexually provocative content and yet another for a petition to stop the legalisation of abortion in Liberia. Based on three samples alone, the victories claimed by the group misinform either by omission or by misrepresenting the facts. While they don’t declare what methodology they employ before terming a campaign successful or “victorious,” the move to protect Kenya’s churches from taxation was actually made possible by a High Court ruling. On the alleged ban of TikTok in Kenya, this claim has previously been fact-checked and found to be false. The parliament discussed a petition to ban TikTok in August 2023, but this motion was not passed. Instead, Kenya’s government in April 2024 directed TikTok to file compliance reports every three months in a bid to regulate the content platform in lieu of completely banning it. As for the petition to stop the legalisation of abortion in Liberia, the CitizenGO petition quotes unfounded claims initially made by an online news outlet that the Swedish government allegedly paid each Liberian senator USD 20,000 to legalise abortion. Apart from three other blogs that published the allegation, the claim was not reported on any credible Liberian news outlet. According to a report by the Mozilla Foundation, CitizenGo was behind sponsored smear campaigns against Kenya’s 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the 2021 Surrogacy Bill. The campaigns were evident online through hashtags such as #stopsurrogacybillKE #notoabortionKE and #Notoabortionincovid19, the campaigns further targeted Kenyan lawmakers who supported the bills via hashtags such as #stopkihikaabortionbill #passarisabortionkills and #KihikaAbortionBillSuspended. The Mozilla report further states that influencers behind the campaigns were reportedly paid between USD 10 to USD 15 per campaign by individuals on behalf of CitizenGO. Ignacio Arsuaga had initially founded the controversial HazteOir organization, which precedes its global-facing arm, CitizenGo. The organization is connected to Spain’s right-wing political party called Vox Party. Based on a report by the Washington Post, CitizenGo funds and is funded by divisive ideologies and politically aligned proponents globally. The organization was involved in fundraising for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016 and is not only determined on anti-choice campaigns but is also aligned with Islamophobic movements, the Washington Post reveals. Contrary to data protection laws, CitizenGo automatically adds any emails responding to their petitions on their mailing list without consent. Subsequent emails ask for donations and signatures for newer petitions. Is it possible that Western foreign influence operations are dragging African countries like Kenya into culture wars whose endgame only they understand?"
3,Key highlights from first Africa climate summit held in Kenya,https://globalvoices.org/2023/09/14/key-highlights-from-first-africa-climate-summit-held-in-kenya/,Some African campaigners have opposed the summit’s approach to climate finance,Zita Zage,14 September 2023,"Screenshot from YouTube video,‘ African Climate Summit 2023: Opening Ceremony of the Ministerial Day – The Power of the Potential’ by the African Union . It shows Kenyan President William Ruto as he gives a speech during the opening ceremony of the 2023 Africa Climate Summit held in Nairobi, Kenya. Fair use. On Tuesday, September 4, the inaugural Africa Climate Summit (ACS) kicked off at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, organised by the Kenyan government and the African Union. During the summit, African leaders in attendance agreed to lead the way in finding sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. The leaders who were present at the summit included Samia Suluhu (Tanzania), Paul Kagame (Rwanda), Évariste Ndayishimiye (Burundi), Filipe Nyusi (Mozambique), Salva Kiir (South Sudan), Sassou Nguesso (Congo), Mostafa Madbouly (Egypt), Nana Akufo-Addo (Ghana), Mohamed Younis Menfi (Libya), Julius Maada (Sierra Leone), Sahle-Work Zewde (Ethiopia), Brahim Ghali (Sahrawi), Azali Assoumani (Comoros), Ismaïl Omar Guelleh (Djibouti), Isaias Afwerki (Eritrea) and Macky Sall (Senegal) along with the host, Kenya's President William Ruto. Africa is no stranger to the devastating impacts of climate change. From prolonged droughts to erratic weather patterns to the displacement of two million children and the extinction of wildlife, the continent has been grappling with the consequences of climate change. In fact, during the summit, President Ruto noted in his opening speech that Africa, despite being a mild contributor to pollution, is experiencing the most severe impacts of global warming. During the summit, Afrobarometer, a research organization, presented findings from surveys conducted in 36 African countries, revealing that a majority of citizens demand urgent government action on climate change. However, only 52 percent of those polled were aware of climate change, with awareness varying across countries. Among those aware, most believe that climate change is making their lives worse, particularly in Madagascar, Lesotho, Mauritius, Malawi, and Benin. The urgency of the situation is undeniable, and the Africa Climate Summit is a testament to the commitment of African nations to address this crisis head-on. During the summit, African leaders expressed their commitment to finding sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. They stressed the need for Africa to be at the forefront of climate solutions and highlighted the importance of seizing the moment to offer green growth and decarbonization solutions. President Ruto said: We cannot pursue climate action through insular, solitary policies. Global warming cannot be mitigated by air-conditioning our little pockets and corners of the world. He emphasized the need for Africa to play a central role in addressing climate change and urged for decisive actions rather than playing the blame game. This article from Africa Newsroom highlights some of the statements made by the leaders as they noted that climate change and the continent's development are closely linked. President Kiir of South Sudan said Africa must utilise its vast renewable energy resources to reverse the effects of climate change. He was supported by Eritrea's President Afwerki who said it was time for Africa to mobilise its own resources instead of relying on handouts. The leaders also emphasized the interconnectedness of climate change and Africa's development and the need for collaboration with developed nations. They called for radical action, the mobilization of Africa's own resources, and streamlined access to international climate finance. President Ruto also called for a more equitable international financial system to address Africa's debt burden.  Those attending also spoke about the need for a paradigm shift in the allocation of global climate change funds and the launch of the Green Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for Kenya. A report by Euronews highlighted the fact that Kenya recently lifted a ban on commercial logging, raising concerns about environmental conservation. And despite Kenya's efforts in renewable energy and banning single-use plastic bags, challenges in climate-friendly adaptations persist. According to a report by BBC, rising water levels in Lake Baringo, Kenya that were due to climate change have led to increased risks of attacks by hippos and crocodiles, threatening the livelihoods and safety of local communities. The residents of Lake Baringo have filed a lawsuit against the Kenyan government for failing to respond to the climate crisis and are demanding financial compensation for the loss of land, farms, and for exposure to water-borne diseases. Additionally, a report by AfricaFeeds noted that many African campaigners have opposed the summit’s approach to climate finance, saying it advances Western priorities at the expense of the continent. Mohamed Adow, the director of energy at the Power Shift Africa think tank in an X (formerly Twitter) post said: David is right that Africa is blessed with a youthful population, amazing renewable resources and rich biodiversity. But trying to shackle Africa with failed carbon markets is just a false solution imposed by the Global North who are the real beneficiaries — Mohamed Adow (@mohadow) September 5, The first African Climate Summit marks a pivotal moment in the collective resolve of African nations to address the formidable challenge of climate change. African leaders seem to have united with a shared commitment to take the lead in finding sustainable solutions despite the controversies and challenges that persist. While the road ahead may be fraught with obstacles, the key takeaways from this summit offer hope that Africa can and must play a pivotal role in addressing the global climate crisis."
4,A staycation anyone? This Kenyan hospital defied the law to advertise a vacation with social media influencers,https://globalvoices.org/2022/11/09/a-staycation-anyone-this-kenyan-hospital-defied-the-law-to-advertise-a-vacation-with-social-media-influencers/,Is there anything wrong with a hospital offering a staycation?,Njeri Wangari,9 November 2022,"A photo of a room in a Kenyan Hospital. Image source SIM USA. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0) On October 28, 2022, Kenyan social media influencer Mungai Eve posted photos advertising a staycation at a small outpatient clinic on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi. The Instagram post, which appears to be a paid engagement, elicited strong reactions and public discourse among Kenyans online around the advertising and ethical standards of healthcare providers. The clinic, Komarock Modern Healthcare, has a controversial history of working with social media influencers. However, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council (KPMDC), a statutory authority established to ensure the provision of quality healthcare, has neither commented on nor fined the clinic in the past or recently. In April 2021, the Council fined three hospitals for false advertising. Komarock Modern Healthcare also has a controversial history of medical abuse and misconduct. From being accused of negligence that led to the death of patients undergoing procedures, to former patients lodging a formal complaint with the KPMDC against the clinic in 2021. As Dr. Rowena Njeri a health systems activist advised the public to lodge official complaints to the council over and above just sharing their stories and experiences on Twitter, little remains to be seen of the past formal complaints that former patients have lodged against the clinic. In her Instagram post, Mungai, a  journalist and digital content creator with more than 500,000 followers on Instagram wrote: A post shared by Mungai Eve (@mungai_eve) The post which, at the time of publishing this story had over 21,000 likes, has so far elicited scores of comments as her followers “try and guess.” It doesn’t disclose that it's a paid partnership. However, it is the question that Muthuri Kinyamu, an expert in the hospitality industry and the founder of Turn Up Travel posted on his Twitter page that has elicited strong commentary whilst eliciting two moral questions into the public discourse. Is Komarock hospital now offering staycations to influencers? pic.twitter.com/4ouFYAEEmz — Muthuri Kinyamu (@MuthuriKinyamu) October 28, 2022 What are the rules and regulations for healthcare providers around advertising and the use of influencers? Is it ok for hospitals to offer staycations? But first, what are staycations? Staycations — holidays spent in one’s home country, more often involving day trips to local attractions — became popular in 2020 following the COVID outbreak which restricted international travel. Faced with an international tourism crisis that lasted over two years, Kenya’s hospitality industry, which for the longest time only focused on and catered to international tourists, had no choice but to find innovative ways of attracting citizens as local tourists. Despite being Africa’s top travel destination for safaris, Kenya’s tourism industry suffered devastating effects from the pandemic. As the demand for quick yet affordable getaways has grown, so has the need by companies to create awareness about themselves and their service offering. Enter social media influencers. Whereas the concept of using social media influencers to market staycations is now a mainstay with the hospitality industry globally, the idea of a hospital using an influencer to advertise and market their premises for a staycation not only seems absurd but morally appalling, according to many Kenyans online who reacted to the Instagram post after it was cross-posted onto Twitter. Clause 7 of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board Act of 2016 prohibits health institutions from advertising, soliciting, or attracting business or patients where undue influence is used through arranged referrals. No medical or dental practitioner or health institution shall seek to advertise, solicit or attract business or patients through any of the following means— Prohibited means of attracting business. (a) an “intermediary” that would amount to professional touting; (b) unsolicited contact; (c) false or misleading statements, or where undue influence is used; and (d) arranged referrals where commission or otherwise is arranged or paid. It is therefore not surprising that many Kenyans were quick to call out the clinic even as many brought the advertising to the attention of the medical practitioners’ board for their intervention. It bothers me when people want to invest more in influencer advertising than actual Quality improvement. But the public needs to understand that stories on the streets don’t help. Please file a complaint officially with @KmpdcOfficial if you feel violated in any way. — Dr Rowena Njeri (@footsoldierRow) October 29, 2022 Influencer marketing has become a multi-billion dollar industry as social media continues to form an integral part of the strategy for businesses and organisations due to its relatively lower cost of advertising compared to Above the Line (ATL) channels such as TV and radio. A 2019 Social Publi study by research firm GeoPoll found that 93 percent of marketers have used Influencer Marketing. Over half of those surveyed said they regularly allocate at least ten percent of their budget to advertising via social media. Komarock Modern Healthcare is hardly the first clinic in Kenya to use influencers to advertise its services a clear contravention of the act. However, they have become the most visible due to their engagement of various well-known Kenyan personalities for social media marketing. While speaking to the media in April this year, the KMPDC Deputy Director Communications and Public Relations Simon Kiraithe said: “The use of celebrities, influencers and other high profile individuals to advertise or subtly recommend some hospitals is not in line with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists (Practitioners and Health Facilities) Advertising Rules, 2016.” Beyond issuing press statements, the council is yet to set a precedent that will reign the hospitals in despite calls by the public. Whilst some questioned why the clinic, Komarock Modern Healthcare, needed so much ‘hyping,’ others shared their disturbing history with the health institution. Many have raised red flags about the clinic’s aggressive marketing strategy with some suggesting that it may be a case of ‘where there is smoke, there's fire.’"

A section of his petition details reads: The news that the IMF recently approved a Kshs. 255 billion loan to the Kenyan government has left many Kenyans shocked and very disappointed. This is due to the fact that previous loans to the Kenya government have not been prudently utilized and have often ended up in mega corruption scandals. These scams have not deterred the ruling Jubilee government's appetite for more loans, especially from China. Right now, Kenyans are choking under the burden of heavy taxation, with the cost of basic commodities such as fuel skyrocketing, and nothing to show for the previous loans. Our President, Uhuru Kenyatta, is even on record lamenting that Kshs. 2 billion is lost daily to corruption in Kenya. The same President recently approved a luxury car grant bribe to get junior lawmakers to pass controversial changes to the Constitution, punching another hole on an already shoestring budget. At the time of filing this story, over 230,000 Kenyans had so far signed the petition with many sharing the link on their social handles. The Kenyan Twitter community, also known as KOT, has become a force to be reckoned with. Due to the ubiquity of low-cost cell phones, a huge cross-section of Kenyans are online and for many, platforms such as Twitter have become an important avenue to not only air their opinions but also to organize and rally behind a common cause. A recent article written by this writer for Global Voices reported how the Kenyan government and Police are cognizant of the power that the Twitter platform yields. With Kenya going into an election in 2023, activists such as Boniface and many others are warning social media users to “Brace themselves” for an increase in the arrest of bloggers and activists as the state doubles down its misuse of the anti-cybercrime legislation to muffle dissent. Update: We had erroneously indicated that the bail  posted for Kenyan Activist Mutemi wa Kiama was $500USD, the correct bail amount was $5,000USD. This error has been rectified."

A Creative Commons image by Flickr user, Erik (HASH) Hersman, June 3, 2007. (CC BY 2.0) Global Voices sub-Saharan Africa in conjunction with Rising Voices will host a Twitter campaign as part of the project, “The identity matrix: Platform regulation of online threats to expression in Africa,” from April 20 to May 22, 2020. Building on “Writing Toward Freedom: Politics and digital rights in Africa,” this five-week social media outreach initiative will involve a curated dialogue on @GVSSAfrica featuring five African language activists who will focus on the intersection of language and digital rights. The activists will tweet in African languages like Bambara, Igbo, Khoekhoe, N|uu, Swahili, Yorùbá, in addition to French and English. They will also share their personal experiences and insights using a language lens on challenges and threats to digital rights. The conversations will interrogate how threats to net neutrality marginalize digital content in African languages; the expansion of mis- and disinformation in African languages on various digital platforms and what companies or civil society are doing about it; the effects of a lack of affordable internet connectivity in places where there are large communities of speakers of an African language; the importance of and challenges for the right to access information in digital spaces in African languages. They will also look at corporate policies, as well as ongoing challenges that may affect how citizens can freely express themselves in their language. The Twitter conversations will be anchored by Denver Toroxa Breda (Khoekhoe/N|uu/English) from South Africa, Adéṣínà Ghani Ayẹni (Yorùbá/English) from Nigeria, Kpénahi Traoré (Bambara/French) from Burkina Faso, Roseblossom Ozurumba (Igbo/English) from Nigeria and Bonface Witaba (Swahili/English) from Kenya.

Photo by Pernille Baerendsten, used with permission. Elections annulled. Media gagged. A citizen deported. These phrases are easy to find in today's headlines in Kenya. The ceremonial “swearing-in” was meant to be a symbolic gesture by the main opposition party led by Raila Odinga. But it has triggered a series of events leading to a clampdown on media freedom and a threat to the right of citizenship in Kenya. To understand what is happening in Kenya, one must begin with the contentious presidential elections of August 2017. After the results showed sitting president Uhuru Kenyatta winning by a slim margin, opposition candidate Raila Odinga challenged the results in court. On 1 September, the Kenyan Supreme Court annulled the election of Uhuru Kenyatta, due to “irregularities and illegalities” in the system, making Kenya the first country in Africa to have a presidential vote annulled by a court ruling. The court subsequently called for a repeat election. Raila Odinga did not participate in the re-run, and encouraged his supporters to do the same, arguing that systemic flaws that produced these irregularities had not been addressed, and that a free and fair election was therefore impossible. Repeat elections took place on 26 October and were marked by protests, multiple incidents of violence and destruction of property. In the repeat election, Kenyatta garnered only 7.4 million votes from a voting population of 19.6 million. His win was upheld by the same Supreme Court. Due to the dubious legitimacy of the repeat election, and the fact that Kenyatta did not earn the support of even half of eligible voters in Kenya, Odinga's National Super Alliance (NASA) party have since argued that the people of Kenya were denied their right to vote for him as their president. This became the basis for symbolically swearing him in as the so-called “people’s president” , which was planned for 31 January of this year. Days before the oath ceremony that was set to take place in the country’s capital city Nairobi, President Uhuru Kenyatta and other executive staff were reported to have summoned media managers and “threatened to shut their stations down and revoke their licenses” if they proceeded with the broadcast, which the government felt was a threat to national security. All the major TV channels ignored this directive and went ahead with the live broadcast. What followed was the switching off of the transmission signals of four privately owned media outlets: NTV, KTN, Citizen TV, its sister station, Inooro TV. Three journalists at NTV — Linus Kaikai, Larry Madowo and Ken Mijungu — told Reuters that security agency sources warned them they'd be arrested, and that plainclothes officers came to their office and hovered outside the entrance, threatening to arrest them if they tried to exit the building. The Kenya Media Council condemned the network suspensions and muzzling of the press by the government, calling the situation “the greatest threat and assault on freedom of expression.” On February 1, Kenya's High Court suspended the shutdown of the affected stations. The government defied the court order for a week, until it finally switched NTV and KTN News back on after seven days, and Citizen TV and Inooro TV after ten days, on 8 February. The clampdown on the TV stations’ transmission signals over an event that was largely viewed by Kenyans as symbolic (and not official), left many in shock.

Some have voiced support for the move by the government, “so that it may be a lesson” to the opposition. Honestly I think #MediaShutDownKE should continue. There's less political debates in households. Less gambling ads, less irritating political analysts, less drama.

Machio malingu (@eng_machio) February 6, 2018 A cross-section of Kenyans did not see the shutdowns as an infringement on media freedom or their right to seek information, as many took the time to berate news organizations, arguing that they did not having the interests of Kenyans at heart: Dear TV Stations,
When you are done with the Government, take time and go for a retreat, and rethink. Re-engineer the whole approach to information industry. Because your consumers are no longer with you.

Miguna is a writer, solicitor, and firm supporter of NASA. Miguna was deported to Canada on 7 February, in what many government authorities described as his “return home.” Miguna was born in Kenya, but also holds citizenship in Canada. He had run for Nairobi governor — and was cleared by the electoral body to do so — in the 2017 election, but he lost. Kenya just illegally deported Miguna Miguna to Canada, a prominent opposition politician with dual citizenship. What next? pic.twitter.com/lmG6wKby1X — Larry Madowo, first of his name (@LarryMadowo) February 6, 2018 This recent turn of events has brought to the fore the question of citizenship. Many Kenyans are split on whether the government had a basis and legal right to deport a Kenyan citizen out of his country, though the constitution clearly protects the citizenship of any person born on Kenyan soil. To whom does the blame lie on#DCI#IG or#Immigration department #MigunaDeported pic.twitter.com/KxQLuVnW9H — Dante_deuces (@Josephdancan1) February 7, 2018 In a press statement released by AllAfrica.com, Miguna described the events that led to his deportation. The Ministry of Interior claims that he revoked his Kenyan citizenship, which he holds by birth, but Miguna said he had never done so. Miguna subsequently filed suit against the government and on 15 February, Kenya's High Court ruled in his favor. Justice Kimaru said that Miguna's deportation “had no merit in law” and ordered authorities to relinquish his Kenyan passport within seven days. Many Kenyans have expressed their anger at the latest government move in what is a clear violation of the human rights of a Kenyan citizen, whose only offense was to use his power as a barrister to legitimize Odinga's symbolic swearing-in. How can you say someone born in Ahero, who went to Onjiko High School, NYS training at Gilgil before joining UON not a Kenyan. Do you guys even have Conscience? @OleItumbi , Power is fluid it won't last forever, that's Miguna @MigunaMiguna at UON #migunadeported pic.twitter.com/b43QzgHC6v — michael_myless1 (@Michaelmyless1) February 7, 2018 The media clampdown, disregard for the Kenyan judicial system by the executive branch, and the illegal deportation of a Kenyan citizen despite a standing court order is going to have far-reaching implications for human rights in Kenya. With the recent events, the illusion of an independent Kenyan media that is free from state interference has evaporated. The disregard for human rights continues to play out in the local and international media as Miguna Miguna continues to fight his extradition from Ontario, Canada."
9,Kenyan Government Allegedly Pays Social Media Influencers to Promote “GreedyDoctors” Hashtag,https://globalvoices.org/2017/02/15/kenyan-government-allegedly-pays-social-media-influencers-to-promote-greedydoctors-hashtag/,N/A,Njeri Wangari,15 February 2017,"Mothers queuing for treatment, Sindo District Hospital, Nyanza, Kenya. Photo by UK Department for International Development via Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) Since October 2015, there have been reports on Kenyan social media about the so-called “36 Bloggers” — a group of 36 social media influencers purportedly hired by the federal government to defend its interests online. Often referred to as “The Itumbi Boys” or “Itumbots”, the group curates online discussions, spreads propaganda and otherwise works to change narratives that are deemed to be critical of the current Kenyan government, through the creation of counter hashtags or by hijacking any existing hashtags that put the administration in a bad light. It is believed that the bloggers were hired by State House Director of Digital Communications Dennis Itumbi and are working under the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit based at State House. #TalkToRuto why did you hire 36 bloggers to spread propaganda and counter any critic? pic.twitter.com/WwPGsliuL0 — Ojijo Dancun Oyieko (@OjijoDanOyieko) September 28, 2016 The issue of the 36 bloggers has gained prominence online, following a nationwide strike by Kenyan doctors. In December 2016, 5,000 Kenyans doctors from all state hospitals went on strike to protest the government's failure to implement and honor the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) it had entered into with the doctors’ union in 2013. Ongoing since December 5, the public support for the strike has been bolstered by allegations of millions of dollars having gone missing from the Ministry of Health. It has also brought the public healthcare system to a halt. The effects of the strike escalated on February 13, 2017 when an appeals court judge ordered that seven officials from the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentist Union (KMPDU) be jailed for contempt of court in failing to call off the the ongoing strike. From the very beginning of the strike, the 36 bloggers created four hashtags: #DaktariRudiKazi, (loosely translated as “Doctors, go back to work”), #GreedyDoctors, #MyBadDoctorExperience, and #DaktariMmetuchosha (loosely translated as “Doctors, we are tired of you). The hashtags have been countered not just by union members, but also by Kenyan social media users who refuse to buy into the rhetoric that the doctors are a greedy, incompetent lot, allowing innocent Kenyans to die. This caused the efforts of the allegedly paid influencers to backfire. The Secretary General of The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), the body that governs all Kenyan doctors, alleged that the 36 bloggers are getting paid more money than what the government has allocated for medical research in the country: #GreedyDoctors sponsored at Kshs 20 million to 36 bloggers vs 5000 doctors promised Kshs 11 million a year for Research. Priorities please! — KMPDU Sec Gen (@fnoluga) January 13, 2017 The Twitter account of the doctors’ union also questioned the rationale behind the hashtag #GreedyDoctors, by posting a summary of the content of the CBA: #greedydoctors? Our “greed” is to have a better health care as outlined in our CBA. @fnoluga has outlined the “greed” points below! pic.twitter.com/WNiXruGmw9 — kmpdu (@kmpdu) January 13, 2017 Referring to one of the other hashtags, #DaktariRudiKazi, Dr. Mo shared a post by an ordinary Kenyan who was defending the doctors against malicious propaganda: Here's from a REAL Kenyan that sees through the propaganda & double standards. #DaktariRudiKazi is one of those propagandas!#LipaKamaTender pic.twitter.com/RUDszU605T — Dr.Mo (@Moshexxx) January 12, 2017 Omar Bond tweeted: How I wish kenyans were as angry about massive corruption , looting and mp/mca Salaries as they are about #GreedyDoctors. Hypocrites! — Omar Bond (@AstronautKE) January 17, 2017 Poriot Teko pointed out that the hashtags created by the group have flopped: So #GreedyDoctors was a flop #mybaddoctorexperience a flop I wonder what @OleItumbi ‘s errand boys will serve tomorrow. #implementcba — Poriot Teko (@PoriotTeko) January 16, 2017 Although there are a number of mission hospitals affiliated to different religious denominations, their capacity has been strained over the last two months due to the influx of patients, many of whom can’t afford private health care. Not all Kenyans are seeing this crisis from the viewpoint of the doctors. Many of those affected directly have an ailing close relative and are expressing their disappointment and disapproval for both parties in the crisis. AbdulKarim Taraja, whose family member has been suffering in hospital since the beginning of the strike, felt that doctors need to go back to work: My kin has been suffering for a whole 2+ months in hospital I don't care if someone sleeps on the deck #HealthCrisisKe — Abdulkarim Taraja (@Abdtaraja) February 13, 2017 John Muiru also felt that the doctors should return to work as negotiations continue: Can the Doctors embrace the return to work formula, as the concerned bodies come to a consensus, we are suffering #HealthCrisisKe — John Muiru (@ThisisMuiru) February 13, 2017 Meanwhile, patient deaths in hospitals continue to rise. There has not been an official number provided by the Ministry of Health of the patient death toll due the ongoing strike. There is, however, an estimate of 300 deaths from a Kenyan media house, KTN: KTN yesterday estimated 300 have died since the start of the Doctors strike — Intellect Mogul (@GicheruGicheru) February 2, 2017 Some of these cases are making their way to Kenya’s social media space. Writing about the deaths, Soko Analyst said: The senseless deaths I have witnessed have scarred me in ways I don't know how I will recover #DoctorsStrike https://t.co/YJdzC0tHAD — SokoAnalyst (@SokoAnalyst) February 1, 2017 Teddy Eugene narrated: 3 pregnant women denied admission at Mwala hospital, lose their infants in attempt to give birth by themselves #NursesStrike #DoctorsStrike — The African Voice (@teddyeugene) February 3, 2017 Some like Kiprono do not support the strike at all due to how doctors treat patients under their care: I may want to support doctors strike but to remember how they treat patients esp those in public hospitals is sad — kipro kiprono (@terer_aaron) February 2, 2017 The worst affected by the doctor’s strike are the nation’s poor who can’t afford private healthcare, many of whom go to the nation’s biggest referral hospital, Kenyatta Hospital. As the battle to improve public healthcare in Kenya continues, the battle of the hashtags will definitely continue on social media."

Photo by Flickr user Trocaire. CC BY 2.0 In this two-part series, young voices from Kenya share their struggle and hopes, as the devastating drought pervading the Horn of Africa was followed by unusually heavy rains, in a world that is warmer now than any time in recorded history. The testimonies in this series were collected by the Climate Impacts Program at 350.org, an organisation building a global climate movement, and are published on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. Part two is written by Unelker Maoga, an environmental conservation student. Read part one here. For the past few decades Kenyans have been longing for change, change in government practices, change in development strategies, change in national issues. Now, our country is experiencing a different kind of change in the near horizon. Drastic, unexpected change; change we were not looking for: climate change. Today, I and many in Kenya have become familiar with newspaper headlines that read: ‘Starvation Claims 14 Lives’; the Governor of Samburu declared a state of emergency as 60% of the locals face food insecurity. His exact words were: ‘We will not survive this drought’. Unelker Maoga shares a personal account of the painful impact of the drought in Kenya. Photo: Unelker Maoga For the first time in history the southern Voi River, located in Voi County, has dried up. Locals have been unable to water their gardens to the point that even the hope of a meal is now non-existent. Appeals to the national government to help address the situation have been made. In the meantime, farmers are reaping losses while pastoralists watch their cattle die. I grew up in Kisii County, in the western part of Kenya. This region contributes largely to Kenya’s fruit basket, but we too have noticed the absence of rainfall. In the 1970s my family built a dam within the land my grandfather owned. The dam has been there since I can remember, but in the last two years weather patterns across the country have taught our family not to take this reservoir for granted. As we experience the second round of drying up, the future remains uncertain. Kenya has been forced to redefine water as a scarce commodity rather than a basic need. What scares the most out of and me other fellow citizens is our inability to solve the situation. To a large extent, the power to mitigate climate change does not lie in our hands. The entire population of Ajawa, in northern Kenya, spends most of their day worrying about water supplies rather than focusing on development issues. Nothing else seems to matter except that very “basic need” we call water. For hours and kilometres on end, members of the community walk to the nearest borehole, then descend 30 meters into a cave-like well to fetch water for their cattle before the break of dawn. That well appears to be the only source of survival. Others prefer to keep away from the well, having been attacked by wild animals when trying to reach it. There have also been cases of women having miscarriages because of the long distances they are forced to walk in order to fetch water. Our county governments, especially in Wajir, have heard the cry of pastoralists and funded veterinary offices to help them manage hundreds of thousands of livestock in order to minimise the drought-related deaths. Though helpful, these measures seem to be too little and too late, as the sun continues to scorch a large percent of Kenya. The Kenyan economy loses 14 billion Kenyan Shillings to drought every year; the country has lost 3% of its GDP in 2015 alone. More than 10 million people are suffering from the effects of famine and the situation is set to worsen, thousands of lives have been lost and still no solutions have been found. Millions from the Horn of Africa have been migrating south, headed to our country in order to flee severe famine, yet we too are experiencing the same conditions they seek to avoid. As the reality of climate change dawns on us, we watched the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris hoping that the negotiations would be fruitful. We have heard world leaders commend the collective decision made by 195 countries to reduce global emissions in order to not only avoid the 2 ºC warming but pledging to a 1.5 degrees limit. Even as we begin, we dare to hope that this path will one day lead to the end of the combustion of fossil fuels. And while we in the Horn of Africa continue our journey in search of a stream of water and look to the skies for long awaited rains, our plea is that the words of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon will never be forgotten: … the time has come to acknowledge that national interests are best resolved by acting in the global interest and solidarity. Nature is sending urgent signals, peoples and countries are threatened as never before… We need to protect the planet that sustains us, for that we need all our hands on deck."

Medicine found me when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I have a particularly vivid memory of hearing my dad get up in the middle of the night to go attend to an emergency in the hospital. Dad was already a hero in my little beating heart but that night, lying in bed imagining what he’d been called to do and how many lives he’s get to save, he was elevated to superhero status. I remember trying hard to stay awake and wait for him to tell me all about his “adventures”. Sadly, sleep won that battle. However, the seed had been sown and I always knew I’d be a doctor one day, a superhero who saved lives"

WARNING : Avoid @WestgateMallKe in Weslands Heavy shootout reported #RedCross Ambulance @EMS_Kenya at scene ^PO — Kenya Red Cross (@KenyaRedCross) September 21, 2013 Ogola runs the Kenya Red Cross's social media command center, a cluster of computer screens at Red Cross headquarters in Nairobi. It's where I visited him earlier this month, before the attacks. In the last year, Ogola has turned Kenya Red Cross social media into a virtual 911 [emergency phone number in North America], taking in information about emergencies and putting out public safety bulletins, 24 hours a day. “The information I get online, it's amazing,” says Ogola. “You get the exact location of where the incident is, you get photos, how many people injured, where, and how far. Previously it was really hard.” Ogola says he has helped coordinate response to hundreds of emergencies, liaising with social media users on the scene and emergency services countrywide. All with the help of ordinary Kenyans on their mobile phones. “Kenyans thought, ‘Whoa, I can actually save someone's life with a touch of a button,'” he says. “And it went viral.” Here's how it works: you see an accident, a shooting, or a fire; you tweet, or Facebook, or text Kenya Red Cross. Ogola does a cloud search, scanning social media for photos, location tags or other information on the same incident. Within minutes, he hands it over to first responders on the ground. “If we get a security tweet we forward it to the police. If we get a fire alert about a building burning, we forward it to the fire brigade, and we call a backup team,” Ogola says. “We have actually become the reporting tool for all kind of incidents. We never had any reporting tool in Kenya.” Kenya's public emergency services are notoriously threadbare. What started as a small fire at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport this summer gutted a terminal before firefighters got it under control. There's no national 911-type number for medical crises, and no comprehensive national disaster plan. But thousands of Kenyans are plugged into Red Cross social media, through their mobile phones and tweet-to-text services. In emergencies, often, the Red Cross is their first call. “Even the government sometimes falls back on us instead of having their own systems in place,” says Joanne Gitau, an ambulance dispatcher for Red Cross EMTs, “especially when the emergencies occur on a really large scale.” The terror attack on the Westgate mall was Kenya's biggest crisis since the 1998 embassy bombings. Red Cross, and social media, have been on the front lines. Over Skype a few days after the attacks, Philip Ogola told me about people who were trapped inside, tweeting the Red Cross for help. “I was getting tweets from guys in the basement parking. I was getting tweets from the injured. I was getting tweets from guys who were hiding in the building,” he says. “I was getting tweets from the public, saying, ‘My mom is inside.'” Ogola set up a hashtag, #RedCrossTrace, to help match tweets from Westgate with worried loved ones outside. From his iPad at the triage station outside the mall, he put out updates about casualties, first aid, missing persons, and counseling services, and helped organize an unprecedented nationwide blood drive. Now, Twitter has been buzzing with posts calling him a hero. He says he couldn't have done it without social media. “It would have been totally impossible to comprehend the situation on the ground, to know the needs of the people, to actually even publish information of what we need. It was easy for me to tweet and say, ‘Hey guys, we need syringes, we need gauzes, we need water.’ And the ripple effect was instantaneous.” Kenya Red Cross has more than 100,000 followers on Twitter, and 26,000 on Facebook. On a normal day, Ogola says, his posts and reposts reach 5 million people. Since the Westgate attack, he says, they've gone viral, reaching 50 million, around the globe. Links"
15,Kenyans Flood Polls Despite Election Day Violence,https://globalvoices.org/2013/03/05/kenyans-flood-polls-despite-election-day-violence/,N/A,Ndesanjo Macha,5 March 2013,"Machete-wielding separatists left at least 13 dead in Kenya as millions of people turned out in historic numbers to cast their votes on March 4, 2013 in one of the most watched general elections in Africa since the country's elections in 2007 ended in ethnic bloodshed. Sporadic acts of violence marred the otherwise peaceful election, the country's first under its new 2010 constitution. Voters chose candidates for president, members of parliament, county governors, senators, county assembly representatives, and women county representatives. Official results are expected to be announced by March 11, 2013. Many were concerned over a possible repeat of the violence that exploded after the 2007 presidential elections. More than 1,100 people were killed and 600,000 were displaced after those disputed election results triggered clashes between tribes. @Nairoboy shares this photo on Twitter asking, “If this woman, as old & frail as she is, came out to vote, what's your excuse?” Photo source: @Nairoboy The National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders branch in Kenya (@nchrdkenya) reported that armed men were allegedly breaking into homes and stealing IDs during election day 2013 [Global Voices has not confirmed this report]: @nchrdkenya: Alleged Starehe constituency 50 men armed with “pangas” and 2 pistols are breaking into homes and stealing IDs and phones.#kenyadecides But despite fears of renewed violence, voters turned out by the millions: @WanjiruMachari1: #KenyaDecides #Elections2013 some polling stations in #Nakuruare waiting for formality to close. recorded over 80% voter turn-out Early predictions indicated that the high turnout could shatter the record set with the 2010 constitution referendum, according to National Media Editor Charles Onyango-Obbo (@cobbo3): @cobbo3: Highest turnout for a vote in Kenya was in 2010 constitution referendum; 72.2%. #KenyaDecides 2013 could hit 80% plus!

17,French Coach Appointed to Change Kenyan Football Fortunes,https://globalvoices.org/2012/09/01/french-coach-appointed-to-change-kenyan-football-fortunes/,N/A,Richard Wanjohi,1 September 2012,"On 29 August, 2012, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Chairman Sam Nyamweya announced that former French footballer and coach Henri Michel has been appointed national team coach. After a string of bad results from the national team and missing out on two consecutive Africa Cup of Nations, as well as failing to reach the finals of regional football tournaments, FKF officials are feeling the pressure to find a way to get results. Bloggers in Kenya had their own views about Henri Michel's appointment. Chenga Funga states this in his post ‘The Rule of Knowns‘: A 3 way dilemma. That’s what has led FKF to Henri. Michel Simply put, would you rather the known-known, known unknown or unknown unknowns? After witnessing the Harambee stars struggle to strike lustre in the beautiful game, stakeholders have been touting names foreign to the Kenyan tongue for the national team’s top job. The dilemma therein. Others have been tried and tested in the recent past, and not many have impressed: Francis Kimanzi, “Ghost” Mulee, Antoine Hey and Zico, didn’t quite cut it. So Sam Nyamweya and Football Kenya Federation opted to chance with the known-unknowns, Raymond Domenech (yes, him), Claude Leroy, Oto Pfister, Adel Amrouche and Frenchman Michel from a more extensive shortlist. Many boast noteworthy success under their managerial careers and therefore felt equal to the task. Put in mind our football team is a wild card. Has been for a while now. In a minute way, VERY MINUTE, our position is similar to England’s, currently bossed by Roy Hodgson. Bags of potential, no actual results. Admittedly, we should be thankful for the national coaches we have had, but life goes on, and it has, with Frenchman Henri Michel. Our known unknown. MutuaMaundu‘s blog also played down the expectations put on Monsieur Michel: The whole country has almost gone hysterical about it. To many, Henri Michel is the much-needed messiah to the Kenyan soccer that has literally seen the worst. The French-man may have unrivalled feathers to his cap, but as a nation that has suffered heartbreaks and anguish due to an under-performing national team, let us tone down our expectations. It will be prudent not to expect too much."

21,Kenya: Bloggers Pay Tribute to Wangari Maathai,https://globalvoices.org/2011/09/27/kenya-bloggers-pay-tribute-to-wangari-maathai/,N/A,Ndesanjo Macha,27 September 2011,"African bloggers are paying tribute to Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmental and political activist who died Sunday after a battle with cancer. “Rest in Peace Mama Africa,” says Susan: News of demise of Nobel Peace Laureate Prof. Wangari Maathai after a long battle with cancer is shocking. I have been wondering why she has not featured much in news lately even with succession politics of 2012 getting hot and when Kenyans need the opinion of women like her. Kenyans will surely miss this humble and noble lady. Rest in Peace Mama Africa. Wangari Maathai. Image by Flickr user On Being (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0). Taabu notes that Wangari was a first in almost everything: She came. She battled. She won. She was a first is almost everything she put her head and heart into. The first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. The first African woman to win the coveted Nobel peace prize in 2004 for her conservation efforts. And now a bright light has been dimmed. The cruel hands of death have snatched Prof Wangari Maathai from our midst. Shame!! The death of this distinguished lady marks the end of an era epitomized by Wangari's love for nature/trees and environment but above all else her relentless fight for social justice and freedom. Death, how cruel is thee? But we will shame you by choosing to celebrate the productive life of Prof Wangari Muta Maathai, an icon who lived well ahead of her time. Mwalimu Mati writes a personal memory of Wangari Maathai: A week ago I was asked by a friend in the United Nations system to try and find Prof. Wangari Maathai because they were unable to. My task was to communicate to her that on October 31st 2011, the United Nations Population Fund wished to have her attend a special ceremony of seven world leaders (including heads and past heads of governments and states) to commemorate the event of the global human population crossing the 7 billion person mark. Wangari Maathai’s office did not let on, but it is now apparent that she was not going to make that date in New York. This morning I woke to the sad news of her passage. Wangari Maathai was someone I knew from childhood. She was a great friend and contemporary of my parents and so I will always appreciate how, as I joined the ranks of the struggle, she always treated me with collegial respect; even when I had no clue what I was doing. Simon thanks Wangari in Swahili: Asante kwa yote,…
…..hasa kwa kutukumbusha,…
……. nguvu ya MTU MMOJA katika JAMII!
Pumzika Mama! Mwangi remembers when Wangari was beaten up by security guards during a demonstration in Nairobi: In 1989 Maathai's protests forced then President Daniel arap Moi to abandon a personal plan to erect a 62-storey office tower in a Nairobi park. In 1999 she was beaten and whipped by private security guards during a demonstration against the sale of forest land near the capital Nairobi. The famed Freedom Corner, now remains a sacred reference place where most protests are started or ended in Nairobi. SW Maina describes her as a woman who refused to bow: A true believer. A fighter. An icon of courage. She fought for the environment – our forests – against more powerful foes – askaris armed with batons, trigger happy police officers, a myopic government of fools – and all she had was her trademark leather ankle boots and tree seedlings – and she won. Her legacy lives on. She has inspired many to not bow to any pressure in the quest for sustainable development – development that does not destroy the environment – and she has also inspired many African women. To be strong. To believe in themselves. To be proud of being African women. Opalo remembers as kid watching Wangari on television: I remember as a kid watching TV and seeing a woman who was the head of the greenbelt movement being chased around by armed policemen. All I knew was that she was fighting to protect Karura forest and freedom corner in Nairobi from land grabbers. This woman was Wangari Maathai, the first woman in eastern Africa to receive a PhD. She would go on to win the Nobel Peace Prize and do all Kenyans proud. Gukira identifies key lessons for humanity from her work: Wangari taught us how to be audacious: to speak and act fearlessly in the face of insurmountable odds. To care for futures yet to unfold. To care for strangers in worlds to come. To act with conviction. To care about the public spaces we share, and to ensure those spaces remained public. Indeed, the history of public space in Kenya is inextricably linked to Wangari’s name. She made it possible for us to envision acting when we thought action was impossible. She acted to create beauty. Wangari is an inspiration to S. Wangene: When I was a little girl, Prof. Wangari featured a lot on TV because of her work. I often saw her fight, cry, on behalf of the environment. It wasn’t until I was older that I understood her passion, what she lived for, what she had a heart for. This woman was one person who gave her everything no matter what stood in her way. She is an inspiration to me. This is how Sokari wants her readers to remember her: In her honour let us continue to plant trees, plant seeds of life, plant good governance, plant love of each other It is exactly what Naomi Mutua is doing: Following the demise of Wangari Maathai, I thought it only sensible to get people to plant trees, and I thought that if we could do this together, even better. This is what has progressed so far: a) I have spoken to the foresters at Karura Forest. They will provide an acre of land, and the seedlings to do so. We will do this at Karura for logistical reasons. However, this doesn’t mean that you cannot go and plant trees on your own initiative, elsewhere. Plant as many as you can! b) We have to raise at least 280,000/-. 80,000/- will be used to clear the land of shrubbery, so that you can walk through it and plant trees, as well as 200,000/- to maintain the seedlings. I still have not factored in the costs of providing portable loos and dustbins at the site, as well as water for the seedlings (any volunteers?) An update of Naomi's initiative: Hello everyone, Thank you so much for the support that you’ve given for the #WangariTrees Campaign. So far, we have raised Kes. 58,050, via Mpesa and Pledges. We are still way off target, as we need Kes. 280,000/- to ensure that an acre of land with 1,100 trees is planted and tended for 3 years at Karura forest. The Mpesa number to send your donations is: 0717-704133, registered under Naomi Mutua. Hot Secrets posts a list of personalities and celebrities who have expressed their condolences to her family: Wangari Maathai’s death has been felt by many. Despite Trending on Twitter, thousands of personalities and celebrities have expressed their condolences to the family for this profound loss. Nelson Mandela’s Twetter page remembered the fallen legend by posting a link to photos of her lecture during the 3rd Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture on the foundation’s Face Book. The Passing of a Humming Bird is a poem dedicated to Wangari by Mburu Kamau: The bird hummed where eagles feared,
Sang the taboo words,
Tuned to the emancipation of masses,
With an ecstatic difference. She walked where angels feared,
Talked the language of the voiceless,
When the breeze blew against all odds
And put on a brave march. As the dawn for our liberation – the Second Birth,
She stood for the truth, with fearless attitude,
And earned a viper’s wrath."

Activista has selected activists from 10 countries on five continents to form part of a “Blogger Swarm” which will be blogging on the Activista website over the next 12 months. Their goal is to get youth around the world involved in discussions about development, and especially food and climate justice. The new bloggers have just completed an intensive workshop in Tanzania where they have been trained in journalism and technical skills, like video production. Two years ago, 31 Global Voices bloggers mentored participants of another ActionAid workshop in Denmark. One former mentee, Casper Knudsen, is now an organizer of the new Blogger Swarm. Our hope is that the mentors will provide friendship, technical support, and feedback as they accompany the new bloggers on their journey into the online world.

This wave of rushing water came from the Ewaso Nyiro River which has burst it's banks following heavy rain around Mount Kenya. The Ewaso Lions blog writes: Around 5am this morning [4 March], a giant flashflood came down the Ewaso Nyiro river, washing away lodges and camps. Our friends at Elephant Watch and Save The Elephants [STE] managed to reach high ground, but the camps were wiped out. Elsewhere, people were on treetops and roofs waiting for help. The British Army, Tropic Air, and others spent the day evacuating people out of the area. Paula Kahumbu shares on the Baraza blog a communication from the Save the Elephants whose research base was destroyed: Today we woke up to reports from our guys at the research centre that Samburu is under water! The whole of Samburu is flooded! All our tents have been washed away! Our research camp as we know it is gone! Luckily all our guys are safe but hanging from trees and at hilltops waiting to be rescued by helicopter! Paula's blog post says, “As of now the flood waters are apparently receding but all the camps in Samburu and Shaba have been evacuated.” This is in anticipation of more rain that is likely to come. The Ewaso Lions bloggers say, “What’s especially frightening is that a lot more rain is expected.” The Ewaso Lions posted some photos – together with an appeal – which were sent by their blogger, Shivani, who's currently in Samburu.  The appeal urges people to donate through the blog or to contact their Nairobi office (for those in Nairobi and wishing to give food and clothes).

41,Blogging Gives Kenyan Poetry Larger Meaning And Exposure,https://globalvoices.org/2009/02/17/blogging-has-given-kenyan-poetry-a-larger-meaning-and-exposure/,N/A,Ndesanjo Macha,17 February 2009,"Njeri Wangari is a Kenyan poet and blogger based in Nairobi, Kenya. I recently interviewed her at Nairobi Java House in downtown Nairobi and later continued the interview via email. In this interview, Njeri discusses how she has been using her blog, Kenya Poet, to promote artists and art scene in Kenya. Through her blog, she says, she has given Kenyan poetry a larger meaning and exposure. Question: When did you start blogging? I started in 2006. Q: Why did you decide to blog? I had been writing poetry for sometime and had not found a publishing house to publish my work. This was frustrating because I wanted to share my thoughts on various issues of concern with people. I cannot remember how I came to know about blogging, maybe it was through Google. But once I found this amazing tool I started to experiment immediately. Initially, I was not sure what to write or what to put there. The first item was about people who inspired me. I wrote about Maya Angelou [the African American writer and poet] then later I realised that a blog is a tool to share your personal interests. I am interested in art, literature, African, jazz and Neo Soul music and poetry. I started doing features on my blog about writers and poets in Kenya and elsewhere. My first feature was on Okot p'Bitek [the Ugandan poet and writer]. I realized later that I needed to update my blog more often and it was not easy to do that with my full time job. I asked myself why not do reviews of art events that I frequent? So I started art reviews. The reviews drew more traffic to my blog as some would have photos accompanying them. At that time there were no online resources offering information about arts in Kenya. One had to check the weekend newspaper, which only featured major events . I later on decided to post information about upcoming events and also tried to find more information about the artists going to perform and with time, this drew more traffic to my blog than even my poetry as I could not post a piece everyday as I could with other art information. There is, however, an interesting aspect, after my poetry performances I would get enquiries on where my poetry can be found and I simply refer them to my blog. You will therefore find those who visit my blog specifically for news and information on art and music and those who visit just for my poetry. Q: What is the difference between the reviews that you do and the ones on weekend newspapers? Newspaper reviews are too formal and most journalists have no or very little knowledge of the subject matter especially when it comes to non mainstream art events like poetry performances and underground hip hop and emerging forms of music. I realized that a lot of reviews that were appearing on mainstream media was mostly criticism of poetry and the quickly growing art scene that is seeing a lot of first time poets coming out to perform. In addition to this, journalists tend to look at poetry in the lenses of written poetry and have no understanding of spoken word and poetry performance. WAPI [Word And Pictures] has received criticism from mainstream media while it gives a space to many upcoming artists and has contributed a lot to the growth of hip hop and other forms of art not just in Kenya but it is now in more than 5 African countries. I also noted that mainstream media reviews lacked the personal style of review that is more detailed, descriptive and does not have to be a certain number of characters. Q: As a poet what do you think is the role of art blogs? The role of art blogs is to give a space to creative writers to express themselves, be heard globally and get feedback as well as critique and support. Blogs help to create greater understanding of various forms of art and appreciation. Q: What value have you added to Kenyan poetry as a blogger? I have given poetry a larger meaning and exposure. Events such as the ones that take place in various spots e.g Rhythm and Spoken at Dass Restaurant, utenzi at the Wasanii Restaurant and others would never be known were it not for the information that I give on the blog. Poetry lovers would probably not know very promising Kenyan poets like Tim Mwaura, Obaladan, Number 8, Neema Mawiyo and many other great poets. I have inspired many upcoming poets to not only share their work on stage but also to start blogs. The weekly newsletter that I send to subscribers about art events and artists has also helped maintain a fanbase of dedicated followers of art and poetry. I am currently hosting some upcoming poets temporarily as I help them start their own blogs. Their poetry can be found on my blog with brief biographies about them and their contacts. Q: Do you have poets who come to you to ask about blogging? Many! Poets complain about not getting published. I tell them why wait for publishers while you can do it on your own? You don't need highly technical skills to start a blog, what you need is to know what you want to do with your blog. There is Neema, for example, who is also a poet and actor and blogger. She blogs at Ngwatilo. I urged and inspired her to start a blog, something she was finding too involving. Bildad Mathenge and Connie Mutua are currently working towards starting their own blogs as I temporarily host their poetry on my blog. Q: Since poetry is both written and spoken, do you have poets in Kenya podcasting their work? You can listen to some Kenyan poets on MySpace. I recently registered a MySpace page. Imani is poet who is using MySpace where you can listen to her poetry. Grand Master Masese who is also a poet and a performing artist is also utilizing myspace Q: What about video? There are a few videos on YouTube that have been taken during various poetry performances. But nothing substantive so far. Q: So you would say that blogging has measurable benefits to the local art scene in Kenya? Yes. It has has made a huge impact. Blogging constantly about poetry has made more people aware of Kenyan poets. It has given exposure to upcoming artists who would rarely get coverage in the mainstream media. Through our blogs, people realise there are many entertainment options and more people get to know more about the Kenya poetry movement. Posting upcoming events and doing a review of the same has also helped quite a lot in disseminating information to art and poetry enthusiasts. It has also helped market upcoming artists who have not yet made their names in the art industry. Q: What are you views on blogging in general in Kenya? Blogging here is still in the phase where most people think you have to be in the IT industry (read geek) to blog. A friend of mine, Daudi Were who blogs at Mental Acrobatics made a comment at our recent meeting regarding the upcoming African Bloggers Conference, and I quote him “blogging is the most ‘ungeeky’ thing one can do on the net”. I am in the organizing committee for the conference dubbed Kelele '09 that aims at bringing African bloggers together for the first time in Kenya later this year. Q: What about the content on Kenyan blogs? Well, most of it is about politics, which is sad. Q: Why sad? People have allowed politics to be the only topic worthy discussing and blogging about despite the fact that there are many other issues affecting Kenyans every day, which need to be part of public debate. It is not like other things in society are not happening. There is more to life than politics. Again, blogs are about one expressing him/herself freely and I refuse to believe that we can only express ourselves politically. Q: What other topics would you like to see in the blogosphere? There are many as everyone is unique and so are their ideas. What I tell people is to write about things you have a passion for. I have a cousin who attended a recent barcamp event held in Nairobi. He is a medicine student in his final year with an interest in IT. He realized that he can write about medicine because there are many issues related to medicine that would be of help to ordinary people. Reading his blog is more refreshing as there are things maybe we are afraid to ask doctors. I'd like to read a blog of a struggling drug/alcohol addict, the memoirs of lawyers, the struggles of a lesbian in Kenya, etc. Q: What are you best Kenyan blogs? Bankelele: Simply because i don't like financial news written for financial analysts! I want financial news for ordinary people. I want to know what economic meltdown means. Bankelele breaks things down. White African: I like IT stuff. He writes stuff that you will not find in newspapers. Sports Kenya: I am not very much into sports but he writes very well, he puts sports into historical perspectives and gives behind the scene sort of stories to sports news making headlines Gukira: I like his command of the English language. Thinker's Room: I think he has been busy lately. Q: What are your long term plans? I want to elevate my blog, Kenyan Poet, to a unique online brand that represents all forms of art on Kenya."

43,Yellow Humvees and the UN Procurement Scandal,https://globalvoices.org/2008/11/18/yellow-humvees-and-the-un-procurement-scandal/,N/A,Juliana Rotich,18 November 2008,"The use of SUVs by UN staff in Nairobi is rankling some bloggers. They are posting pictures on their blogs, and have even created a flickr pool called ‘Kick The Habit’. The title of the set of pictures borrows from UNEP's (United Nations Environment Program) campaign from June of this year, which encouraged ‘countries, companies and communities’ to reduce their CO2 emissions. The blogger on Sukuma Kenya started the flickr pool in June, after he noticed that many UN vehicles in Nairobi were SUVs, and felt that the UNEP campaign did not communicate how it was reducing carbon emissions while it was asking individuals to ‘kick the CO2 habit’. On the 27th of October, the Journalist-blogger Nick Wadhams noticed a yellow Humvee with United Nations vehicle plates. He posted a picture on his blog, noting a recent report about the United Nations procurement scandal. Is it any surprise that Saturday's Nation newspaper contained this item: “The United Nations office in Nairobi may have lost Sh10 billion in procurement and administrative scandals over the past three years, an internal audit report has revealed.” Sadly, this kind of thing was a common story when I covered the U.N. Maybe all that money is going to banana yellow Humvees. Earlier this month, Nick posted an update after confirming that the yellow Humvee did belong to a UN employee. PS: I was driving on James Gichuru Road the other day, climbing the hill as it approaches Wayaki Way, and what should I see hurtling in the opposite direction? You guessed it, the B.Y.H! I caught only the briefest of glimpses of the driver (was that you, Charles?), and considered turning around and following him. But there were two other passengers in our car, one of whom happened to be an eight-month-old baby who was angry about being 45 minutes late for a one-year birthday party. Next time, Charles! Next time! PPS: In the spirit of full disclosure, I should note that we drive a 1989 Mitsubishi Pajero, which, to be honest, probably gets worse gas mileage than Charles’ Humvee. At the moment, there is a problem with the injector pump and it spews a lot of black smoke. Working on it! Commenting on the post, the blogger Baba Mzungu makes the point that NGO's often use 4x4s as they travel to remote areas, but he takes issue with the fact that the Humvee is driven by an ‘IT guy’ in Nairobi( an urban area that is hardly the beaten path). As a representitive of an NGO who travels off the beaten track (and let's face it, some of the beaten tracks aren't fantastic), I can see the arguement for using a 4×4. But an IT guy? In Nairobi? Driving the biggest bl00dy tank available?
Don't think so. The Sukuma blog posts a humorous rhyme about the UNEP campaign and continued sightings of UN 4×4 vehicles. The rhyme was penned by Ed of African Works blog. “Isn't it a bummer
when you buy yourself a hummer
and some prat puts you down on the net!
Global warming's just for fairies
the science about it undoubtedly varies
and most of its apologists are wet.
So even though I work for UNEP
I am rightly proud of my rep
as an aging but highly sexed eco czar
in a oversized gas guzzling toy of a car” The sightings of SUVs appear to be continuing, as the blogger on NairobiKoll chimes in on the Sukuma blog with a link to a picture they took recently. For a copy of the full report on the UN procurement scandal, the blogger Kenyan pundit made the PDF available for download on her blog. Update Nov 23rd 2008: Nick Wadhams was able to categorically identify the owner of the yellow hummer, and had a chat with him. He posts a conclusion to the BYH saga on his blog."

Nambiza Tungaraza,30 January 2007,"Following their virtual conference last November, Tanzanian bloggers are currently discussing the details of the organization they are intending to form. A blog has been set up by the interim committe, to facilitate the process. So far, they have chosen the name for the organization, Jumuiya ya Wanablogu Tanzania (the community of Tanzanian bloggers). The current discussion is about leadership structure. There will be a single item for discussion every week. Later on, there will be an open competition to design the logo of the organization. Zanzibar: CIA's Role in the Zanzibar Revolution, No More Miniskirts, and Sauti za Busara Mid January is when Zanzibaris remember the 1964 revolution that ousted Sultan Jamsheed Bin Abdullah’s regime. The story of the Zanzibar revolution has either been told through the official government version or has remained shrouded in secrecy and conspiracy theories. Majid Mjengwa, a college instructor and journalist in Tanzania, posts an article by a Tanzanian columnist Nizar Visram who is of the view that Zanzibar revolution was not a sporadic event but rather a long process which involved the majority of Zanzibaris, various political parties and foreign powers keen to marginalise leftist elements in Zanzibar politics. To highlight the role of foreign powers, Visram digs into the London Public Records Office and the CIA archives now available to the public and refers to the 1961 British Resident governor‘s letter to his government: Waraka huo unaonyesha wasiwasi wao kuwa uongozi wa chama cha ZNP unachukuliwa na viongozi wa mrengo wa kushoto akina Abdulrahman Babu. Mkakati ukaandaliwa ili kuimarisha uongozi wa Sheikh Ali Muhsin na kumuondoa Babu. Visram notes that to understand factional conflicts within Zanzibar political parties it is important to revisit CIA report written at the time of the revolution: Our aim should be to strengthen the nationalist government led by Abeid Karume. The communists such as Babu and [Kassim] Hanga must also be stopped. Nyerere believes that they (Babu and Hanga) are African nationalists as well. We do not believe that. Steps should be taken to convince the British to take a firm stand, USA can either pursue covert diplomatic steps or economic and technical assistance, but the British have to take charge. Jambo la kimsingi huko Zanzibar ni kuzuia utawala usishikiliwe na Wakomunisti. Kwani serikali iliyopo sasa ni mchanganyiko wa wazalendo wa Kiafrika na Wakomunisti, kila upande ukiwa unavutia kwake. Wasiwasi wetu ni kuwa hawa wazalendo wanaweza wakawekwa kando. Lengo lazima liwe kuimarisha serikali ya kizalendo ikiongozwa na Abeid Karume. Ni lazime pia juhudi zifanywe kuminya upande wa wakomunisti akina Babu na Hanga. Nyerere anaamini kuwa hawa nao ni wazalendo wa Kiafrika ambao wanaweza kutumikia nchi yao. Hoja hiyo tunaikataa.” Hivyo kila jitihada zifanywe ili kuwashawishi Waingereza wachukue hatua imara, Marekani inaweza kuchukua hatua za kidiplomasia kwa njia za siri au kusaidia kiuchumi na kiufundi, lakini Waingereza ndio wanapaswa wawe msitari wa mbele. Kibunango, who mainly blogs about Zanzibar political and socio-cultural issues, reflects on the new code of conduct passed by the ethic and development committee of Nungu village, in Zanzibar. The code bans miniskirts, prostitution and alcohol. Nungwi villagers have recently being extremely concerned about the level of moral decadence in their midst, which Kibunango links it to the growth in the tourism sector. Nungu is a popular tourist destination. Kibunango supports the move by the villagers to protect their moral identity, but argues that a niqab is not a Zanzibari dress: Na iwapo vazi la kizanzibari ni kama lile la kuvaa baibui na hijabu yake, basi sheria hiyo itakuwa inalenga zaidi maadili ya kidini kuliko maadili ya kizanzibari, na itakuwa sio kosa kuhoji kauli ya serikali ya kusema kuwa nchi hiyo si ya kidini. Na kwanini wananchi ambao sio wa dini fulani washurutishwe kuvaa baibui? Ndesanjo reminds his readers that the annual music festival in Zanzibar, Sauti za Busara, will take place next month. Tanzanian Politics: Defection and Protesting Against $12M Secret Payment And in the mainland Tanzania, although some of the opposition parties’ cadres have recently defected to the ruling party, the opposition is down but not out. Mwandani questions defectors principles and motives. He sees the defection the same as having Tanzanian soccer players joining the Senegalese national team. Photoblogger Issa Michuzi posts photos of a peaceful demonstration, organised by Tanzania's opposition parties in Dar Es Salaam to call for accountability and transparency. Following an investigation by UK's Serious Fraud Office into UK's biggest arms supplier BAE Systems, the opposition alleges that Tanzania's government officials not only wasted taxpayer's money but may have acted inappropriately while purchasing a radar from England. The Wretched of the Earth in Tanzania and Kenya Tanzanian photoblogger Maggid Mjengwa attended the World Social Forum 2007 in Kenya and visits Kibera in Nairobi, which is arguably the biggest and oldest urban slum in Africa. Mjengwa did a wonderful job of covering the forum with his camera. Elsewhere in the Swahili Blogosphere, a Tanzanian Film maker, Sultan Tamba, is irked by EATV‘s television program “Uswazi” in which the presenter visits the squalid areas of Dar Es salaam showing the worst living conditions. “Uswazi” is a Swahili slang for a lowlife lifestyle. … Lakini kwa maana ya mtangazaji huyo anayoionyesha kwenye kipindi chake, USWAZI ni maeneo mabovu, machafu, ya Kipumbavu na hasiti kuonyesha kuwa wanaoishi kwenye mitaa hiyo ni watu tofauti, wanaoishi kwenye kisiwa kinachojitegemea kiasi kuna wakati anapokuwa kwenye mitaa hiyo akirekodi kipindi hudiriki kutamka tena kwa kurudiarudia, “Mtazamaji nina hakika katika maisha yako hujawahi kupita sehemu kama hizi!” Halafu ataisifia sana mitaa hiyo na kila anachokiona – sifa ya kejeli – kwamba hii ndiyo mitaa bora kabisa ndugu mtazamaji!” Anasema hivyo huku akijua kwamba anaongea kinyume! Kwa ufupi nionavyo mimi, hiki ni kipindi hiki cha dharau na matusi ya rejareja dhidi ya wakazi wote wanaoishi kwenye mitaa hiyo na Watanzania kwa jumla kwa sababu asilimia 70 ya Watanzania wanaishi kwenye mazingira hayo!
