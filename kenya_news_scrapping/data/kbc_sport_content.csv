Trent Alexander-Arnold announces Liverpool departure,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trent-alexander-arnold-announces-liverpool-departure/,2025-05-05T12:54:20+03:00,,"Trent Alexander-Arnold announced Monday he will leave boyhood club Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season, saying it was the “hardest decision” of his life. The England defender, who helped Liverpool win the Premier League this season, has been heavily linked with a free transfer to Real Madrid. “After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season,” the 26-year-old posted on X. “This is easily the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my life.” Liverpool’s Premier League success moved the Reds level with rivals Manchester United on 20 top-flight titles. “I know many of you have wondered why or been frustrated that I haven’t spoken about this yet, but it was always my intention to keep my full focus on the team’s best interests, which was securing No. 20,” Alexander-Arnold’s said. “This club has been my whole life — my whole world — for 20 years. From the Academy right through until now, the support and love I have felt from everyone inside and outside of the club will stay with me forever. “I will forever be in debt to you all. My love for this club will never die.” Alexander-Arnold made his senior debut in 2016 and went on to make 352 appearances for the Reds to date, scoring 23 goals and lifting eight major honours. “Alexander-Arnold will depart with our gratitude and appreciation for his contribution during a sustained period of success,” Liverpool said in a statement on their website."

"Chelsea sink champions Liverpool, Man Utd crash at Brentford",https://www.kbc.co.ke/chelsea-sink-champions-liverpool-man-utd-crash-at-brentford/,2025-05-04T22:04:10+03:00,"Brentford,Champions League","Chelsea improved their chances of qualifying for the Champions League with a vital 3-1 victory as Liverpool suffered a Premier League title hangover, while United’s winless league run reached six games after a 4-3 defeat at Brentford on Sunday. Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea took the lead through Enzo Fernandez’s early strike at Stamford Bridge. Jarell Quansah’s second half own goal was followed by Virgil van Dijk’s late reply for Liverpool. Cole Palmer’s stoppage-time penalty condemned the champions to only their third league defeat this season. While lacklustre Liverpool had little to play for after winning a record-equalling 20th English crown with a 5-1 rout of Tottenham last weekend, Chelsea had every incentive to secure a priceless three points. Hoping to return to the Champions League via a top five finish, the Blues sit in fifth place, level on points with fourth-placed Newcastle after their 1-1 draw at Brighton earlier on Sunday. Sixth-placed Nottingham Forest will join Chelsea and Newcastle on 63 points if they beat Crystal Palace on Monday. Third-placed Manchester City are only one point clear of Chelsea and, with three games left, the top five battle is set for a thrilling finale. “Very important three points, especially at this stage in the season,” Maresca said. “For sure, Chelsea has to fight for Champions League and hopefully in the future we can fight for something more important. In this moment we are there and hopefully we can finish there.” Liverpool’s only other league losses in a triumphant campaign came against Nottingham Forest in September and at Fulham in April. Manchester United are languishing in 15th place following the latest setback in their wretched top-flight campaign. Ruben Amorim’s side are focused on salvaging their forgettable season by winning the Europa League. They will host Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final second leg next Thursday protecting a 3-0 lead and Amorim made a host of changes, resting Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. In the 14th minute, Mason Mount scored only his second league goal for United since joining from Chelsea in 2023 as he took Alejandro Garnacho’s pass and slotted home from eight yards. But Brentford hit back in the 27th minute when United defender Luke Shaw deflected Michael Kayode’s effort into his own net. United’s leaky defence were punished in the 33rd minute as Kevin Schade headed Christian Norgaard’s cross past Altay Bayindir. – ‘We cannot do this anymore’ –
United conceded again when Schade struck with a 70th minute header. Yoane Wissa completed the rout four minutes later, poking home for his 18th league goal this season. Garnacho’s 82nd minute blast from the edge of the area was followed by Amad Diallo’s stoppage-time effort for the visitors. But it was little consolation for United, who have lost 12 of Amorim’s 24 league games, winning only six times. “The players have to understand we cannot do this anymore, we know the context of the season and we need to change that,” Amorim said. Tottenham are also looking to win the Europa League to paper over the cracks in a miserable campaign. Ange Postecoglou’s side warmed up for their semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt with a 1-1 draw at West Ham. Tottenham have only one win in their last nine league matches and sit a lowly 16th in the table, leaving them facing their lowest finish since 1976-77. They are aiming to end their 17-year trophy drought by winning a first European prize since the 1984 UEFA Cup. But Postecoglou could still be sacked regardless of the Europa League run. The Australian made eight changes from the 3-1 win in the first leg against Bodo/Glimt to rest his stars for Thursday’s second leg in Norway. Tottenham took the lead in the 15th minute when Wilson Odobert punished West Ham’s sloppy marking to drill home from Mathys Tel’s pass. But Jarrod Bowen levelled for West Ham in the 28th minute, taking Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s pass in stride and shooting through the legs of Tottenham keeper Guglielmo Vicario. Yankuba Minteh gave Brighton the lead against his former club with a fine finish in the 28th minute. Alexander Isak dragged Newcastle level in the 89th minute, netting with a penalty for his 23rd league goal this season."

Karan and Nikhil pumped up ahead of the Pearl of Africa ARC Rally in Uganda,https://www.kbc.co.ke/karan-and-nikhil-pumped-up-ahead-of-the-pearl-of-africa-arc-rally-in-uganda/,2025-05-04T19:52:37+03:00,,"KCB Racing Team drivers Karan Patel and Nikhil Sachania have expressed confidence ahead of the much-anticipated Pearl of Africa Rally slated for May 9 – 11 in Mbarara, Uganda. Reigning African Rally Champion Karan Patel is set to return to action after receiving a significant boost from KCB Bank. Karan secured KShs. 5 million from the bank to purchase a new engine for his Skoda Fabia Rally2, following a mechanical failure triggered by thick “Fesh Fesh” dust at the Camp Moran Stage during the 2025 WRC Safari Rally. Speaking ahead of the competition, KCB Head of Integrated Marketing Nkatha Mutungi said: “Our support for motorsports is largely influenced by the strong desire to put the East Africa region on the global map as a premier motorsports destination. It is part of our broader corporate social responsibility in line with our brand purpose For People. For Better. We will be rooting for our local drivers who will be competing alongside regional heavyweights at this adrenalinepumping event.”  KCB Uganda has committed KShs. 9.5 million to support the upcoming Pearl of Africa Rally Championship, further strengthening its footprint in regional motorsport. The funding will back top Ugandan drivers Mutebi Nasser, Michael George Mukula, and Oscar Ntambi, while a portion will be directed to the Federation of Motorsport Clubs of Uganda (FMU) to aid in event preparations and logistics. For the first time since 1960, motorsports enthusiasts in Mbarara will witness the thrill of the rally that has traditionally been held in other parts of Uganda. Nikhil Sachania alongside his navigator Deep Patel will also be making their debut at the event. The duo will be competing in a Ford Fiesta Rally3 car. The competition will be their first since the 2025 WRC Safari Rally where they emerged first in ARC3 category. Karan and his navigator Tauseef Khan developed mechanical problems and could not finish the race. He has vowed to push the car to the limit in Uganda. He said:“Tauseef and I are eagerly waiting for the Pearl of Africa Rally. Since the event will be held in Mbarara, it will pose extreme challenges considering it is a tough terrain. However, we are ready to test the new engine and to show the world that we are the best at what we do. I urge our Ugandan fans to turn up in large numbers because we will give them a show.” Drivers from the homecountry Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda will compete in five stages – Charles Muhangi, Kaguta, Ankole Cow, Moses Lumala, and Rukaari, all named after people and culture associated with motorsports in Ankole region. They will cover a total of 87.46 kilometers in the 3-day showdown."
Man Utd ‘need to change’ after Brentford loss: Amorim,https://www.kbc.co.ke/man-utd-need-to-change-after-brentford-loss-amorim/,2025-05-04T19:48:21+03:00,"Brentford,Kevin Schade","Ruben Amorim admitted Manchester United “need to change” after a dismal 4-3 defeat at Brentford on Sunday underlined the problems facing the Old Trafford boss. Kevin Schade scored twice at Gtech Community Stadium as United’s miserable Premier League campaign took another blow, with their winless league run stretching to six matches. Amorim made eight changes to his starting line-up as he rested key players after Thursday’s 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final second leg. Fielding the third youngest starting line-up in Premier League history — with an average age of 22 years and 270 days — United’s raw rookies were unable to avoid a 12th defeat in Amorim’s 24 league games. Since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag in November, Amorim has been unable to lift United out of the mire. United are languishing in 15th place as they try to avoid their worst finish since being relegated in 1973-74. Amorim has been critical of United’s players on several occasions and he again conceded there is a need for a close-season overhaul of his squad. “It was a reflection of our season. We started well and controlled well, we suffered with the set pieces and throw-ins so we knew we would struggle against them,” he said. “The players have to understand we cannot do this anymore, we know the context of the season and we need to change that.” Mason Mount scored his first goal of the season to put United ahead, but a Luke Shaw own goal and Schade’s strike put Brentford ahead by half-time. Schade got his second with a close-range header from Bryan Mbeumo’s delivery, before Yoane Wissa bagged the fourth from six yards out as United’s defence collapsed. Alejandro Garnacho’s 82nd-minute rocket from the edge of the area and Amad Diallo’s stoppage-time effort put a little gloss on the scoreline for an outclassed United. After two injury-plagued seasons since arriving from Chelsea, Mount’s goal was a rare bright spot for Amorim. “It’s not just the finish, it’s the position he has on the pitch, he’s a third midfielder who can reach the box, he’s really intelligent and he’s getting there,” he said. “He trains really hard, sometimes too hard and I have to pull him back and take him off the pitch because he wants to do more. “He wants to play more minutes and I’m really happy with him.”"
Karen Young Runners Win the ABSA Life 2025 Nairobi Marathon Relay,https://www.kbc.co.ke/karen-young-runners-win-the-absa-life-2025-nairobi-marathon-relay/,2025-05-04T19:37:48+03:00,,"Karen Young Runners clocked 2hours 46 minutes and 15 seconds to clinch the 6th edition of the FWD Nairobi Marathon Relay that was held in Nairobi. They beat Spartans Vanguards who recorded 3hours 19 minutes and 20 seconds to emerge second. Leisurely Leopards finished third, recording 3 hours 21 minutes and 1 second at the event that was graced by 200 teams. Speaking after guiding his team to victory, an elated John Njori said: “It was such a well-organized event. My team and I enjoyed the race. Coming into this competition, we knew that it was going to be difficult considering the names that had signed up for the race. However, with our early preparations and teamwork, we have cruised to victory. A hearty congratulations to all the other participants who came out to run today.” In the ladies’ teams, Warembo wa Badeq clocked 2 hours 52 minutes and 49 seconds to bag the women’s category. Run and Lift 105 was second after clocking 2 hours 55 minutes and 10 seconds. All men teams saw Trafford SportsWear claim victory, recording 2 hours 29 minutes and 12 seconds. Badeq Shop 010 finished second registering 2 hours 29 minutes and 42 seconds.    The first edition of the Nairobi Marathon Relay was held in 2021. The event hosted 22 teams with a restriction due to the pandemic. Since then, it has been inspired by strong themes and has seen tremendous growth, with participants drawn from corporate teams, running clubs, and partnerships with sponsors. It attracted 40 teams in 2022 while the 2023 edition saw 40 teams competing. This event is especially meaningful for us at Absa Life, not just as the title sponsor of the 2025 Nairobi Relay Marathon, but because we’re also celebrating a big milestone, our 10th anniversary. Just like many of you on the marathon course today, our journey hasn’t always been easy. We’ve faced hurdles, adjusted our stride, and kept pushing forward. But every challenge has made us stronger, and every milestone reminds us why we do this. We will continue partnering with FWD in the future to inspire millions of athletics enthusiasts,” noted Waiguru Githanji, Managing Director, ABSA  Life Assurance. The event, which kicked off at exactly 6:30 am, saw each team have a total of six members and every member ran one circuit of 7.2kms before handing over the baton to the next person. Runners from corporates, running clubs, and sponsors featured in the competitive showpiece."
EPL: Manchester United piped by Brentford in 7 goal thriller,https://www.kbc.co.ke/epl-manchester-united-piped-by-brentford-in-7-goal-thriller/,2025-05-04T19:14:03+03:00,,"Brentford kept their hopes of European qualification alive by coming from behind to beat Manchester United in a 4-3 thriller at the Gtech Community Stadium. Mason Mount gave the visitors the lead with just his second goal for the club, finishing off a fine cross from winger Alejandro Garnacho. Brentford equalised when captain Mikkel Damsgaard saw his cross deflect in off defender Luke Shaw, who was captaining a much-changed United side. The Bees took the lead six minutes later in controversial fashion, when Kevin Schade towered over United defender Tyler Fredricson to power in his 10th goal of the season with a superb header. However, United were furious when play wasn’t stopped after defender Matthijs de Ligt went down with an injury earlier in the move. Schade wrapped up the three points 20 minutes from time, heading in his second of the day from close range from a Bryan Mbeumo cross. But Brentford were not done there, with the Bees cutting through United’s defence to allow Michael Kayode to slip in Yoane Wissa for a fourth of the afternoon. Argentina international Garnacho scored a stunning long-range effort eight minutes from time to give United a sliver of hope. United then ensured it was a nervy finish for Brentford when second half substitute Amad Diallo scored five minutes into seven added minutes of injury time, but the Bees saw out the win. The defeat leaves United in 15th, on 39 points from 35 matches, while Brentford move into ninth, one point behind eighth-placed Bournemouth."
Lazio in Serie A’s top four with win at Empoli,https://www.kbc.co.ke/lazio-in-serie-as-top-four-with-win-at-empoli/,2025-05-04T15:58:23+03:00,"Boulaye Dia,Champions League","Lazio moved into Serie A’s Champions League positions on Sunday after a 1-0 win over Empoli in a match which finished with both teams reduced to 10 men. Boulaye Dia’s goal just seconds after kick-off pushed Lazio into fourth place. Empoli had to play over half the match a man down after Lorenzo Colombo was sent off in the 39th minute for a poor challenge on Samuel Gigot. Lazio lost Elseid Hysaj to two bookable offences with 14 minutes remaining but easily held out for the win. However, Lazio’s hold on fourth spot will not last long. They are a point ahead of Juventus who face a key clash at Bologna in the late match. Bologna are a further point back from Lazio in sixth, and Juve’s superior goal difference means Lazio will drop out of the top four regardless of the result at the Stadio Dall’Ara. Lazio host Juve next weekend in another match which could decide who out of six teams will take the two remaining spots in Europe’s elite club competition. Napoli and Inter Milan are well clear of the chasing pack and battling it out for the league title. Atalanta are two points ahead of Lazio in third ahead of their match at rock-bottom Monza, who will be relegated with anything other than a win. Roma, three points behind Lazio in seventh and unbeaten in 18 league matches, could briefly take fourth from their local rivals if they beat another Champions League hopeful in Fiorentina. Empoli remain second-from-bottom and two points behind Lecce, who sit just outside the relegation zone. Lecce are on a run of 20 matches without a win, their latest reverse a 1-0 defeat by league leaders Napoli on Saturday."
Arsenal suffer Bournemouth defeat ahead of PSG showdown,https://www.kbc.co.ke/arsenal-suffer-bournemouth-defeat-ahead-of-psg-showdown/,2025-05-03T21:44:31+03:00,"Arsenal,Bournemouth","Arsenal suffered a blow ahead of their Champions League showdown with Paris Saint-Germain as Evanilson fired Bournemouth to a 2-1 victory at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead through Declan Rice’s opener on his 100th appearance for the club. But Dean Huijsen equalised in the second half and Evanilson completed the comeback to give Bournemouth their first ever away win over Arsenal. Beaten 1-0 by PSG in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday, Arsenal will need a much-improved performance in the second leg in Paris on Wednesday. The second-placed Gunners also still require six points to guarantee Champions League qualification for next season via a top five finish in the Premier League. Arteta admitted this week that it was “very painful” to watch Liverpool celebrate winning the Premier League title last weekend. The Gunners finished as runners-up behind Manchester City for the last two seasons and the Champions League is their last hope of a trophy this term. Arteta is still waiting to win the second trophy of his six-year Arsenal reign, with his last silverware coming in the 2020 FA Cup. Arsenal last reached the Champions League final in 2006 and have never won the tournament. With so much at stake in the Parc des Princes next week, it was intriguing to see Arteta select a full strength side for a relatively meaningless game against Bournemouth. Instead of resting, key stars Rice, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and William Saliba were all in Arsenal’s starting line-up. Jurrien Timber and Mikel Merino were the notable absentees for Arsenal, with Arteta revealing the former will need a fitness test to determine his availability for the PSG game. – Sucker punch –
Bournemouth arrived in north London with an outside chance of qualifying for Europe and had already beaten Arsenal at the Vitality Stadium in October. Evanilson started for Bournemouth after his red card against Manchester United was overturned. The Brazilian forward wasted a golden opportunity when he headed over after Jakub Kiwior slipped while trying to clear Milos Kerkez’s cross. Leandro Trossard went close to the opener as the Arsenal forward stooped to meet Martinelli’s cross with a header that forced a good save from Kepa Arrizabalaga. Rice made the breakthrough in the 34th minute, running onto Odegaard’s precise pass and rounding Kepa to slot into the empty net before celebrating with a bow to the crowd. Evanilson nearly caught out David Raya with a lob from 40 yards after the Arsenal keeper miscued a pass to the striker. Saka should have done better than head tamely at Kepa from Martinelli’s cross immediately after the interval. Saka went closer moments later, nimbly cutting inside for a curler that fizzed past the far post. Arsenal had failed to win nine league games in which they held the lead this season, a failing that played a major role in their title race surrender. And once again Arteta’s side were rocked by a sucker punch as Bournemouth levelled with their first effort on target in the 67th minute. Antoine Semenyo launched a long throw into the Arsenal area and Huijsen eluded Rice as he climbed to loop a header over Raya into the far corner from six yards. The Gunners had lost their way and Evanilson made them pay in the 75th minute. Marcus Tavernier flicked the ball towards the far post and Evanilson poked home, with Bournemouth finally able to celebrate after a VAR check for a potential handball."
Napoli six clear in Serie A after win at fiery Lecce,https://www.kbc.co.ke/napoli-six-clear-in-serie-a-after-win-at-fiery-lecce/,2025-05-03T21:34:43+03:00,"Giacomo Raspadori,Italy","Napoli moved six points clear at the top of Serie A after Saturday’s 1-0 win at Lecce, a match which was briefly stopped by home fans’ fiery protest against the league following the death of a beloved club physio. Antonio Conte’s team are one step closer to a second league title in three seasons thanks to Giacomo Raspadori’s well-struck free-kick in the 24th minute. Napoli await the result of reigning champions Inter Milan’s home clash with Verona later to see just how far they will be ahead of their closest challengers with three matches remaining in the season. Inter have made wholesale changes from the team which drew 3-3 at Barcelona midweek, with the second leg of their Champions League semi-final coming up on Tuesday. And Napoli look good to claim a fourth league crown after a fourth straight win without conceding a goal and ahead of three closing fixtures against also-rans. Lecce meanwhile stay one place and point above the relegation zone and will drop into the bottom three if Empoli beat Lazio on Sunday. The match briefly looked like being called off early on when supporters launched a barrage of flares and firecrackers towards the pitch, forcing the match to be stopped for seven minutes. Fans were protesting Serie A’s reaction to their long-time physio Graziano Fiorita dying suddenly last week at the age of 47. Fiorita’s death hit Lecce hard and the club were enraged at the league deciding to only push back last weekend’s fixture at Atalanta by one day rather than to a later date to help grieving players and club staff. Serie A’s anthem was booed and whistled by the crowd of 29,000, and after a tense minute’s silence for Fiorita fans loudly called the league “sons of bitches”. By the time the game was stopped Lecce had already been given a massive let-off when Romelu Lukaku was ruled to be millimetres offside after turning home Matteo Politano’s shot in the second minute. But Napoli were comfortably the better team in the opening period and were ahead in the 24th minute thanks to Raspadori’s free-kick, which fizzed past Lecce goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone. Kialonda Gaspar headed off the bar in the 38th minute as Lecce pushed for a leveller, while Raspadori flashed wide shortly before half-time. And Napoli held out in a scrappy second half to send the away support wild and pile pressure on Inter."
Russell helps Bath beat Edinburgh in Challenge Cup semi-final,https://www.kbc.co.ke/russell-helps-bath-beat-edinburgh-in-challenge-cup-semi-final/,2025-05-03T21:23:59+03:00,"Edinburgh,English Premiership League","Scotland star Finn Russell enjoyed his return to familiar surroundings as Bath reached their first European final in 11 years on Saturday with a 39-24 Challenge Cup semi-final win away to a gutsy Edinburgh. Bath, the runaway English Premiership leaders, lost players to yellow cards in each half and were down 17-12 in the third quarter as Edinburgh threatened an upset. But in a match being played at the Hive — a venue in the grounds of Murrayfield, Scotland’s national stadium, which Russell knows so well from his Test career — Bath hit back. The southwest side’s power proved decisive, with all six of their tries scored by forwards and Russell adding three conversions and a penalty. Bath will now face with the winner of Sunday’s semi-final between French sides Lyon and Racing 92 in the final of Europe’s second-tier club rugby union competition at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium on May 23. Bath took the lead in the 10th minute as Sam Underhill went over from close range, with Russell adding the extras. But they suffered a setback minutes later when wing Will Muir was sin-binned for a ruck infringement. Edinburgh made their man advantage count in the 19th minute as Mosese Tuipulotu – an early replacement for the injured Harry Paterson – finished off on the left. With Muir back on the field, Bath regained the lead in the 31st minute when Tom Dunn scored off a line-out maul. Ross Thompson’s penalty meant Edinburgh turned round just two points behind and they were in front early in the second half following a penalty try where Bath full-back Tom De Glanville was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on as he stopped Wes Goosen’s pass releasing wing Darcy Graham. But Edinburgh lock Sam Skinner was yellow-carded to even things up, and Bath edged ahead in the 54th minute when Dunn got his second try of the match off a line-out maul, and Russell converted. Replacement Alfie Barbeary added another try just before the hour and Russell’s penalty soon afterwards gave Bath a 10-point lead. Ali Price pulled a try back for Edinburgh but Bath replacement hooker Niall Annett put the game beyond Edinburgh with a close-range score converted by Russell, before Guy Pepper wrapped things up late on."
Second-string PSG beaten by Strasbourg before Arsenal return leg,https://www.kbc.co.ke/second-string-psg-beaten-by-strasbourg-before-arsenal-return-leg/,2025-05-03T21:34:22+03:00,"Arsenal,Bradley Barcola","Strasbourg kept alive their hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League with a 2-1 win Saturday against a Paris Saint-Germain side showing 10 changes from their midweek victory away to Arsenal. A Lucas Hernandez own goal put Strasbourg ahead on 20 minutes and Felix Lemarechal doubled the home side’s lead in first-half stoppage time in Alsace, although Bradley Barcola pulled one back for PSG just after the break. Liam Rosenior’s in-form Strasbourg are now unbeaten in 12 games going back to early February and this victory lifts them up to fourth in the table ahead of the rest of the weekend’s fixtures. PSG have already wrapped up a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title and saw their unbeaten record domestically this season come to an end last weekend. Coach Luis Enrique therefore rested all of those who started the 1-0 win away to Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, with the exception of Portuguese midfielder Joao Neves. Ousmane Dembele, who scored the winning goal against the Gunners, was missing altogether after coming off hurt in the second half of that game. It remains to be seen if Dembele, PSG’s leading scorer with 33 goals this season in all competitions, will be fit for the return leg in Paris on Wednesday. Luis Enrique gave a top-flight debut at the Stade de la Meinau to 17-year-old centre-back Axel Tape and just a third start in Ligue 1 to winger Ibrahim Mbaye, also just 17. Strasbourg took advantage of their visitors’ inexperience as they went ahead on 20 minutes when Mamadou Sarr helped on a corner and the ball went into the net off the unfortunate Hernandez. Goncalo Ramos had a couple of chances for the visitors in the first half but Strasbourg scored again just before the interval. Habib Diarra advanced down the right before teeing up Lemarechal to score with a fine first-time strike from the edge of the area, high into the far corner. Hernandez and Lee Kang-in, who had been struggling with a knock, were both replaced at the restart as another teenager, 18-year-old defender Noham Kamara, came on for his Ligue 1 bow. PSG got a goal back less than a minute into the second half as Barcola ran over half the length of the field before stabbing in his 19th goal of the campaign in all competitions. However, Strasbourg held on for the rest of the game, including through eight minutes of stoppage time. They are now just a point behind second-placed Marseille, who go to Lille on Sunday, and sit only goal difference behind third-placed Nice, 1-0 winners against Reims on Friday. If Strasbourg can hold their place in the top four, they will qualify for next season’s Champions League, having not graced Europe’s elite club competition since 1979/80. However Lille, Monaco and Lyon are all within three points ahead of their fixtures this weekend, with the principality side away to Saint-Etienne later on Saturday."
South Africa bowler Rabada serving ban for positive drug test,https://www.kbc.co.ke/south-africa-bowler-rabada-serving-ban-for-positive-drug-test/,2025-05-03T21:34:29+03:00,"Cricket,Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada","South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada revealed on Saturday that he was serving a ban from cricket for recreational drug use. Rabada, 29, returned to South Africa last month “for personal reasons” after playing only two matches for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League. In a statement issued by the South African Cricketers’ Association, Rabada said his absence was due to “an adverse analytical finding for the use of a recreational drug” which he said resulted in him serving a provisional suspension. The statement did not specify the length of the suspension or when Rabada would play again but Rabada said: “I am looking forward to returning to the game I love playing.” Gujarat have four fixtures remaining in the league phase of the IPL, starting with a match against Mumbai Indians on Tuesday. The team is also well placed to qualify for the play-offs after winning seven of their 10 fixtures. Rabada is South Africa’s leading fast bowler. He has taken 327 wickets in 70 Tests and is expected to play a key role for South Africa in the World Test Championship final against Australia starting at Lord’s in London on June 11. He said in his statement: “I am deeply sorry to all those that I have let down. I will never take the privilege of playing cricket for granted. This privilege is much larger than me. It goes beyond my personal aspirations.” He added: “This moment will not define me. I will keep doing what I have always done, continuously working hard and playing with passion and devotion to my craft.”"
Atletico held at Alaves in dry Liga draw,https://www.kbc.co.ke/atletico-held-at-alaves-in-dry-liga-draw/,2025-05-03T21:04:36+03:00,"Alaves,Antoine Griezmann","Atletico Madrid were held to a dull 0-0 draw at relegation-battling Alaves on Saturday in La Liga. Diego Simeone’s side have little to play for in the final weeks of the season, sitting third with Champions League qualification virtually assured and leaders Barcelona nine points ahead of them. Alaves, however, moved provisionally 16th, three points clear of the relegation zone with an important point against their illustrious visitors. Julian Alvarez was sent off in the only moment to get pulses racing in the first half when he connected high on Argentine compatriot Facundo Garces’ leg, but the referee downgraded his red card to yellow after a VAR review. Simeone took off his son Giuliano and Antoine Griezmann as he looked for more energy, bringing on Samuel Lino and regular super-sub Alexander Sorloth. Antonio Sivera saved a Lino long-range effort, Atletico’s first shot on target, with around 20 minutes remaining as what had been a soporific battle burst belatedly into life. Jan Oblak made a superb low stop to thwart Kike Garcia from close range as Eduardo Caudet’s hosts almost found a way through. Sivera clawed out a Clement Lenglet effort and Angel Correa could not convert at the end of a swift counter-attack as Atletico threatened but could not find a winner. “Neither side could get the upper hand, either in possession or in attack, there were no shots in the first half — the game was played in the middle of the pitch without any danger,” admitted Simeone, who turned his attention to the Club World Cup this summer. “We’ve earned (qualification) on our merit… the Club World Cup, a significant milestone for the last four years of work.” Ayoze Perez struck twice for Villarreal as they beat Osasuna 4-2 to close in on Champions League qualification for next season. The top five La Liga teams qualify and the Yellow Submarine are currently fifth, four points clear of Real Betis who visit Espanyol on Sunday."

The woman accused Vidal, 37, and other players from his first-division Colo Colo side of sexual assault at a club, where the footballers were celebrating a birthday on November 4. “We were able to reconstitute the events of that day and, ultimately, there is no evidence to support charges,” prosecutor Felipe Cembrano said in a video sent to the media. Other unnamed members of Vidal’s team remain under investigation, however. Former Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Inter Milan midfielder Vidal returned last year to Colo Colo, where he started his career at 17. He was part of the so-called “Golden Generation” that led Chile to victory in the 2015 Copa America."

The President noted that Kenya has an abundance of football talent, saying more focus is needed on identifying, nurturing and developing it through conducive infrastructure, planning and training. “I want to assure Kenyans that the government is steadfast in its commitment to uplifting the standards of football in our country,” he said. Saying his administration will continue investing in sports, the President explained that Kenya will draw lessons from global football powerhouses to remain competitive on the world stage. He spoke at State House Nairobi, on Friday, during the reception of the UEFA Champions League Trophy.  Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya, Footbal Kenya Federation President Hussein Mohammed and former Manchester United star Bastian Schweinsteiger were also present. President Ruto said the government, in collaboration with other stakeholders, will continue to invest sufficient resources in nurturing football talent and revamping football infrastructure. “I urge the Football Kenya Federation and all stakeholders to take lead in revitalising the game by nurturing talent from the grassroots to the national and international levels,” he said. The President explained that Kenya has an abundance of football talent, which requires focus on identifying, nurturing, and developing it through training, support and the necessary infrastructure. “We also have much to learn from global football powerhouses like Germany – where Bastian comes from – about what it takes to consistently remain competitive on the world stage,” he said. At the same time, the President emphasised the need to make football and other sports a source of income and wealth, especially for young people. “That is why the government came up with Talanta Hela, an initiative for monetising talents. Many of our youth have already benefitted,” President Ruto pointed out. He said he was pleased to note that Kenya is one of only five African countries selected to host the UEFA trophy during this year’s tour.  “On behalf of the people of Kenya, let me say we are truly honoured to host the trophy once again given the tremendous and passionate support that football enjoys in our country,” he said. He thanked UEFA and Kenya Wine Agency Ltd for bringing the trophy to Kenya, saying it is a delight for football fans. “Many of them may never have the opportunity to be in a stadium and experience the action firsthand. Simply seeing the trophy is, therefore, a very special moment for them,” he said."

Kenya, making their first appearance at the U20 AFCON since 1979, began the match brightly and were rewarded in the 16th minute when Lawrence Ouma rose highest to head home Kevin Injehu’s pinpoint free kick, sending the Kenyan bench into wild celebrations.  However, Morocco struck back just before the break. A scramble in the box saw Yassir Zabiri pounce with a well-placed finish that was eventually confirmed by VAR after initial doubts over a potential infringement. The equaliser sent the teams into halftime level at 1-1. The second half brought even more drama. Just ten minutes after the restart, Zabiri doubled his tally with a sharp header from close range to give Morocco the lead. But Kenya weren’t done yet. Their vibrant forward play paid off in the 71st minute when Hassan Beja rifled in a shot from the centre of the box following clever link-up play with Aldrine Kibet, levelling the scores at 2-2.  Morocco, unfazed, kept pressing and reclaimed the lead in the 78th minute. Reda Laalaoui latched onto a clever pass from Saad El Haddad and slotted past the keeper with composure to make it 3-2. There was late drama when Morocco were awarded a penalty in the 89th minute, but Othmane Maamma’s effort was saved by Kenyan keeper Baron Ochieng to keep hopes alive. Kenya pushed for a third equaliser and came agonisingly close in stoppage time when Aldrine Kibet’s header struck the post. But Morocco held on for three crucial points to go top of the group after Matchday 1. For Kenya, there were plenty of positives to take despite the defeat, particularly in attack where they showed fearlessness and creativity. Morocco, meanwhile, showed composure and experience in key moments and will be confident going into their next match. Kenya faces Tunisia in its second group match on May 4th before playing Nigeria three days later."
