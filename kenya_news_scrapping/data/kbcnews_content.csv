"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."
"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

Kisumu celebrates as Ruto unlocks SGR extension funding,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-celebrates-as-ruto-unlocks-sgr-extension-funding/,2025-04-26T13:25:12+03:00,"Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Governor Anyang Nyong’o","In a major boost to Kenya Kwanza’s Bottom-up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), President William Ruto has successfully negotiated a new financing model with China to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) from Nakuru to Kisumu, a long-awaited milestone for the Lake Region and beyond. The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Leading a high-level government delegation, President Ruto participated in productive discussions with his Chinese counterpart, marking a new era in the Kenya-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. According to Statehouse, the talks resulted in significant diplomatic and economic breakthroughs, enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, infrastructure, and sustainable development. “Discussions between the two leaders focused on key priorities such as trade expansion, investment promotion, and development cooperation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects. The agreements include investments for the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway to Naivasha (Phase II) and from Naivasha to Malaba (Phase III). Additionally, they encompass the expansion and dualing of the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau Summit–Malaba highway, the Kiambu-Northern Bypass, the Eldoret Bypass, and the construction of the Nithi Bridge. “This cooperation cements Kenya’s role as a key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional logistics partner, while integrating East Africa’s transportation network and enhancing intra-regional trade,” he said. Furthermore, the Statehouse spokesperson confirmed that China has opened avenues for increased private sector investment, which will be directed towards the listed infrastructure projects through Public-Private Partnerships, thus accelerating development and deepening economic ties. Thursday’s meeting also saw the signing of financing instruments for the implementation of the TVET III Project, crucial for equipping TVET institutions and enhancing technical skills among Kenya’s youth. Additionally, it included the Intelligent Transport System and Junction Improvement Project for Nairobi, designed to revolutionize traffic management by minimizing human interfaces and streamlining the payment of traffic penalties. “Kenya and China also committed to further collaboration in the rollout of Kenya’s National Digital Superhighway Programme, which involves the expansion of the national fibre optic network. Additionally, both countries agreed to enhance cooperation in road and water infrastructure,” he said. In support of Kenya’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, China pledged grants to improve hospital infrastructure and committed to private sector investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing. A Framework Agreement on Economic Partnership for Shared Development was also signed, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive trade deal. This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion). These agreements cover key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure, and are expected to create over 28,000 jobs across the country. Notable projects include a Special Economic Zone in Kilifi County (expected to create 5,000 jobs) and manufacturing expansions in Machakos, Murang’a, and Mombasa.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."
"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."

Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent.

"Kenya hosts ISO leadership workshop, spotlighting future of standards",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-hosts-global-leaders-for-9th-iso-leadership-and-management-development-workshop/,2025-04-29T11:37:09+03:00,"9th Leadership and Management Development (LMD) Workshop,Director of Metrology & Testing","Kenya is hosting the 9th Leadership and Management Development (LMD) Workshop this week, organized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Leading a high-level government delegation, President Ruto participated in productive discussions with his Chinese counterpart, marking a new era in the Kenya-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. According to Statehouse, the talks resulted in significant diplomatic and economic breakthroughs, enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, infrastructure, and sustainable development. “Discussions between the two leaders focused on key priorities such as trade expansion, investment promotion, and development cooperation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects. The agreements include investments for the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway to Naivasha (Phase II) and from Naivasha to Malaba (Phase III). Additionally, they encompass the expansion and dualing of the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau Summit–Malaba highway, the Kiambu-Northern Bypass, the Eldoret Bypass, and the construction of the Nithi Bridge. “This cooperation cements Kenya’s role as a key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional logistics partner, while integrating East Africa’s transportation network and enhancing intra-regional trade,” he said. Furthermore, the Statehouse spokesperson confirmed that China has opened avenues for increased private sector investment, which will be directed towards the listed infrastructure projects through Public-Private Partnerships, thus accelerating development and deepening economic ties. Thursday’s meeting also saw the signing of financing instruments for the implementation of the TVET III Project, crucial for equipping TVET institutions and enhancing technical skills among Kenya’s youth.

In support of Kenya’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, China pledged grants to improve hospital infrastructure and committed to private sector investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing. A Framework Agreement on Economic Partnership for Shared Development was also signed, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive trade deal. This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion). These agreements cover key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure, and are expected to create over 28,000 jobs across the country. Notable projects include a Special Economic Zone in Kilifi County (expected to create 5,000 jobs) and manufacturing expansions in Machakos, Murang’a, and Mombasa.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production.

Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."

Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion). These agreements cover key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure, and are expected to create over 28,000 jobs across the country. Notable projects include a Special Economic Zone in Kilifi County (expected to create 5,000 jobs) and manufacturing expansions in Machakos, Murang’a, and Mombasa.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

In a world where data has become a vital national asset and cyber threats are increasing in complexity and scale, the KEBS MD believes that the ISMS certification confirms the office’s preparedness to tackle current risks and lead in upholding national security, institutional credibility, and public confidence. “Every day, institutions like this handle substantial volumes of confidential data. Any breach of that information could have far-reaching implications not only for the institution but also for public trust and national stability. By attaining this globally recognised certification, this office has demonstrated its commitment to safeguarding sensitive data, protecting its stakeholders, and affirming its place as a leading audit institution not only in Africa but worldwide,” she explained. Ngari added that KEBS will continue to assist institutions like the Office of the Auditor-General through activities such as annual surveillance audits and technical support, as well as helping to identify opportunities for continual improvement to ensure they remain at the forefront of excellence in public sector auditing and information security. She emphasized that KEBS operates under globally recognized standards, citing its accreditation by the Dutch Accreditation Council (RVA) as a testament to the agency’s integrity, competence, and alignment with international conformity assessment protocols. “This global accreditation ensures that certificates issued by KEBS are recognized not only regionally but also globally — enhancing Kenya’s competitiveness, supporting international trade, and reinforcing our role in the global quality infrastructure,” she said."

The CS was accompanied by the Amb of the Republic of Kenya to the UAE Kenneth Milimo, Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) Holdings Ltd Chair Chege Kirundi and the CEO Wilson Muthaura. The meeting signals Kenya’s renewed diplomatic and economic push to strengthen bilateral ties, ensure stable markets for its agricultural exports, and position Kenyan tea competitively on the global stage. According to Tea Board of Kenya (TBK), during the year 2024, the total earnings from tea amounted to Kshs. 215.21 Billion, out of which Kshs. 181.69 Billion was earned from exports, Kshs. 18.00 Billion from local sales and Kshs. 15.52 Billion from committed stocks. This was an increase of 9% from the marketed value of Kshs. 196.97 Billion recorded in 2023. From the total marketed value, the exports earnings recorded improved performance of 1% (Kshs. 1.12 Billion) to stand at Kshs. 181.69 Billion from Kshs. 180.57 Billion recorded in 2023 attributed to increased export volume by 14% (71.59 Million Kgs) from 522.92 Million Kgs recorded in 2023 to 594.50 Million Kgs. In the same year 2024, Kenya tea was shipped to ninety-six (96) export destinations compared ninety-two (92) in the year 2023. Pakistan maintained its position as the leading export destination for Kenya tea having imported 206.27 Million Kgs, which accounted for 34.7% of the total export volume.  In terms of value, the consignment to Pakistan was worth Kshs. 70 Billion. Other key export destinations for Kenya tea were Egypt whose import volume was 86.90 Million Kgs worth Kshs. 23.96 Billion; UK (57.44 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 16.99 Billion); UAE (30.50 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 10.27 Billion); Russia (28.46 Million Kgs, Kshs. 7.43 Billion); India (17.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 3.94 Billion); Saudi Arabia (15.92 Million Kgs, Kshs. 6.02 Billion); Yemen (14.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 5.52 Billion); Iran (13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 4.26 Billion); and China (12.42 Million Kgs, Kshs. 2.73 Billion)."

The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

This follows the lifting of a nine year moratorium which was effected on November 17, 2015. According to CBK the moratorium was meant to strengthen the banking sector after a series of governance, risk management and operational challenges. “Since then, significant strides have been made in strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for Kenya’s banking sector. Notably there have been mergers and acquisitions by existing players and entry of new domestic and foreign strategic investors into the sector,” said CBK. However CBK says new licences will only be issued to new banks with core capital of Ksh 10 billion as per the Business Law Act 2024. “Following the lifting of the moratorium, new entrants to the Kenyan banking sector must will be required to demonstrate that they can meet the enhanced minimum capital requirement of Ksh 10 billion,” said CBK. Recent acquisition in the sector include sale of National Bank of Kenya (NBK) by KCB Group to Nigeria’s Access Bank Plc which the regulator approved this month."

The Tax Amnesty Programme which begun in December 27, 2024 has so far benefited 2.9 million taxpayers whose tax penalties, fines and interests have been forgiven. “The Tax Amnesty Programme provides an opportunity for taxpayers to clean their tax records through offering a waiver on penalties, interest and fines for tax debts accrued up to 31st December 2023,” said Rispah Simiyu, Commissioner, Large and Medium Taxpayers. According to Simiyu, since the rollout of the programme KRA has also collected Ksh 10.9 billion in principal tax payments.

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."

Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."

Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion).

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

This was an increase of 9% from the marketed value of Kshs. 196.97 Billion recorded in 2023. From the total marketed value, the exports earnings recorded improved performance of 1% (Kshs. 1.12 Billion) to stand at Kshs. 181.69 Billion from Kshs. 180.57 Billion recorded in 2023 attributed to increased export volume by 14% (71.59 Million Kgs) from 522.92 Million Kgs recorded in 2023 to 594.50 Million Kgs. In the same year 2024, Kenya tea was shipped to ninety-six (96) export destinations compared ninety-two (92) in the year 2023. Pakistan maintained its position as the leading export destination for Kenya tea having imported 206.27 Million Kgs, which accounted for 34.7% of the total export volume.  In terms of value, the consignment to Pakistan was worth Kshs. 70 Billion. Other key export destinations for Kenya tea were Egypt whose import volume was 86.90 Million Kgs worth Kshs. 23.96 Billion; UK (57.44 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 16.99 Billion); UAE (30.50 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 10.27 Billion); Russia (28.46 Million Kgs, Kshs. 7.43 Billion); India (17.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 3.94 Billion); Saudi Arabia (15.92 Million Kgs, Kshs. 6.02 Billion); Yemen (14.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 5.52 Billion); Iran (13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 4.26 Billion); and China (12.42 Million Kgs, Kshs. 2.73 Billion)."
KUSCCO gets new 11 member board to steer recovery,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kuscco-gets-new-11-member-board-to-steer-recovery/,2025-04-16T21:38:01+03:00,"KUSCCO,Sacco","The government has appointed a new board of directors to oversee recovery of troubled Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (KUSCCO). The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

This follows the lifting of a nine year moratorium which was effected on November 17, 2015. According to CBK the moratorium was meant to strengthen the banking sector after a series of governance, risk management and operational challenges. “Since then, significant strides have been made in strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for Kenya’s banking sector. Notably there have been mergers and acquisitions by existing players and entry of new domestic and foreign strategic investors into the sector,” said CBK. However CBK says new licences will only be issued to new banks with core capital of Ksh 10 billion as per the Business Law Act 2024. “Following the lifting of the moratorium, new entrants to the Kenyan banking sector must will be required to demonstrate that they can meet the enhanced minimum capital requirement of Ksh 10 billion,” said CBK. Recent acquisition in the sector include sale of National Bank of Kenya (NBK) by KCB Group to Nigeria’s Access Bank Plc which the regulator approved this month."

Govt revokes licenses of 15 mining firms in Kilifi County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/govt-revokes-licenses-of-15-mining-firms-in-kilifi-county/,2025-04-16T10:40:29+03:00,"minerals,Mining","Mining companies operating quarries in Kilifi County are in trouble after the government revoked operating permits and licenses of fifteen companies for non compliance with mining regulations. In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

KALRO unveils Ksh.1.3B facility to develop wheat varieties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kalro-unveils-ksh-1-3b-facility-to-develop-wheat-varieties/,2025-04-14T12:19:46+03:00,"Agriculture,wheat production","The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has inaugurated a new Ksh 1.3 billion ($1m) research facility which is expected to boost wheat production in the country. The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today.

Strategic labour investments to secure jobs during green transition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/strategic-labour-investments-to-secure-jobs-during-green-transition/,2025-04-11T15:03:19+03:00,"employment,green transition","African countries especially those highly dependent on fossil fuels could experience rise in inequality due to job losses resulting from green transition. In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."
"Kisumu Port cargo throughput more than doubles to 280,381MT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kisumu-port-cargo-throughput-more-than-doubles-to-280381mt/,2025-05-05T15:37:24+03:00,,"Kisumu Port has recorded a sharp rise in cargo volumes and vessel activity, cementing its position as a key player in East Africa’s transport and logistics network. According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

Ngari stated that the achievement results from enhancing operational excellence, ensuring that financial statements and audit records are credible, secure, and readily accessible when needed. “On behalf of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, its Management, Certification Body, and the entire staff, I extend our heartfelt congratulations to you for this outstanding achievement. It is a true reflection of your commitment to excellence, transparency, and accountability in public service,” said Ngari. The KEBS Managing Director specifically commended the Office of the Auditor-General for the award, noting its critical role in the nation’s democratic framework. She asserted that the new certification indicates that the Office of the Auditor-General is not only meeting but exceeding international benchmarks in securing information assets, aligning its operations with global standards of public sector governance in the digital age. “The Office of the Auditor-General is entrusted with the immense responsibility of independently auditing and reporting on the management of public resources at both national and county levels. Such a mandate calls not only for institutional integrity but also for robust safeguards around the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information,” she said. According to Ngari, the certification directly supports the Office of the Auditor-General in adopting secure, technology-driven systems that will enhance operational efficiency. In a world where data has become a vital national asset and cyber threats are increasing in complexity and scale, the KEBS MD believes that the ISMS certification confirms the office’s preparedness to tackle current risks and lead in upholding national security, institutional credibility, and public confidence. “Every day, institutions like this handle substantial volumes of confidential data. Any breach of that information could have far-reaching implications not only for the institution but also for public trust and national stability. By attaining this globally recognised certification, this office has demonstrated its commitment to safeguarding sensitive data, protecting its stakeholders, and affirming its place as a leading audit institution not only in Africa but worldwide,” she explained. Ngari added that KEBS will continue to assist institutions like the Office of the Auditor-General through activities such as annual surveillance audits and technical support, as well as helping to identify opportunities for continual improvement to ensure they remain at the forefront of excellence in public sector auditing and information security. She emphasized that KEBS operates under globally recognized standards, citing its accreditation by the Dutch Accreditation Council (RVA) as a testament to the agency’s integrity, competence, and alignment with international conformity assessment protocols. “This global accreditation ensures that certificates issued by KEBS are recognized not only regionally but also globally — enhancing Kenya’s competitiveness, supporting international trade, and reinforcing our role in the global quality infrastructure,” she said."

The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

KALRO unveils Ksh.1.3B facility to develop wheat varieties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kalro-unveils-ksh-1-3b-facility-to-develop-wheat-varieties/,2025-04-14T12:19:46+03:00,"Agriculture,wheat production","The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has inaugurated a new Ksh 1.3 billion ($1m) research facility which is expected to boost wheat production in the country. The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"
Strategic labour investments to secure jobs during green transition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/strategic-labour-investments-to-secure-jobs-during-green-transition/,2025-04-11T15:03:19+03:00,"employment,green transition","African countries especially those highly dependent on fossil fuels could experience rise in inequality due to job losses resulting from green transition. In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

Speaking during the launch of the system, National Treasury Principal Secretary Dr. Chris Kiptoo said eRITS which is built on KRA’s Enterprise Integration Platform, Gava Connect is to set to streamline compliance for the real estate sector from a technology perspective. “The government is committed to ensuring that the tax system remains fair and that compliance is as seamless as possible. With eRITS, we are moving towards a smarter, more efficient tax system that benefits everyone,” said Kiptoo. According to KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga the system is a voluntary compliance tool that aims to support and enhance tax compliance among rental property owners and agents. “eRITS is designed to enable seamless integration with the KRA ecosystem for purposes of tax computation, filing, and payment; and is accessible through the Gava Connect API portal for system-to-system integration, and as a service through the eCitizen platform. The intention is to augment voluntary compliance within the
sector while reducing administrative burdens associated with taxation.” he stated. The Monthly Rental Income (MRI) which was introduced in 2016 is applicable to landlords earning between Ksh 288,000 and Ksh 15 million annually. The MRI tax rate was reduced from 10pc to 7.5pc, from 1st January 2024, demonstrating the Government’s
commitment to easing the burden on taxation among taxpayers. In the last financial year 2023/2024, tax revenues collected through MRI stood at Ksh 14.4 billion, translating to a 5.2pc year on year growth compared to a collection of Ksh 13.6 billion and Ksh 12.3 billion in the previous financial years."
CBK warns of US tariff consequences as shilling holds firm,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cbk-warns-of-us-tariff-consequences-as-shilling-holds-firm/,2025-04-10T11:50:35+03:00,,"Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has dismissed claims of currency manipulation, attributing the shilling’s stability to targeted policy interventions and prudent monetary management. CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."

Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation.

This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion).

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

KUSCCO gets new 11 member board to steer recovery,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kuscco-gets-new-11-member-board-to-steer-recovery/,2025-04-16T21:38:01+03:00,"KUSCCO,Sacco","The government has appointed a new board of directors to oversee recovery of troubled Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (KUSCCO). The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

KALRO unveils Ksh.1.3B facility to develop wheat varieties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kalro-unveils-ksh-1-3b-facility-to-develop-wheat-varieties/,2025-04-14T12:19:46+03:00,"Agriculture,wheat production","The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has inaugurated a new Ksh 1.3 billion ($1m) research facility which is expected to boost wheat production in the country. The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"

In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

Speaking during the launch of the system, National Treasury Principal Secretary Dr. Chris Kiptoo said eRITS which is built on KRA’s Enterprise Integration Platform, Gava Connect is to set to streamline compliance for the real estate sector from a technology perspective. “The government is committed to ensuring that the tax system remains fair and that compliance is as seamless as possible. With eRITS, we are moving towards a smarter, more efficient tax system that benefits everyone,” said Kiptoo. According to KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga the system is a voluntary compliance tool that aims to support and enhance tax compliance among rental property owners and agents. “eRITS is designed to enable seamless integration with the KRA ecosystem for purposes of tax computation, filing, and payment; and is accessible through the Gava Connect API portal for system-to-system integration, and as a service through the eCitizen platform. The intention is to augment voluntary compliance within the
sector while reducing administrative burdens associated with taxation.” he stated. The Monthly Rental Income (MRI) which was introduced in 2016 is applicable to landlords earning between Ksh 288,000 and Ksh 15 million annually. The MRI tax rate was reduced from 10pc to 7.5pc, from 1st January 2024, demonstrating the Government’s
commitment to easing the burden on taxation among taxpayers. In the last financial year 2023/2024, tax revenues collected through MRI stood at Ksh 14.4 billion, translating to a 5.2pc year on year growth compared to a collection of Ksh 13.6 billion and Ksh 12.3 billion in the previous financial years."

CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

This has resulted in an uncoordinated development agenda between the global North and South. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director Dr Mithika Mwenda says incoherent policies can lead to unintended consequences like funding green initiatives while investing in fossil fuels, tightening migration policies and promoting labor mobility policies. According to the Climate Finance Initiative report dubbed Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa 2024, Climate financing for Africa grew by 48pc to USD 44 billion in 2021/22. However, this is only a quarter of what is required to realize its 2030 goals. Experts say that climate action, economic growth and social policies should be designed to strengthen each other rather than creating new vulnerabilities and gaps. Addressing a meeting convened by the European Union Parliament, Dr. Mwenda urged the European Parliament to engage transparently with the global south to ensure commitments are met and financing is predictable and easily accessible. Mithika noted that the Global Gateway Initiative, which targets to mobilize up to €300 billion in investments through a Team Europe approach, should be structured in a manner that enhances global north-south relations. “This is in addition to the Global Gateway initiative, aiming to “enable African countries to integrate their raw materials and resources into sustainable global value chains” by 2030. While, for instance, 63pc of the world’s cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, without mentioning other global south countries providing critical Raw Minerals, it is the best opportunity to advance a just, equitable and inclusive transition.” Dr. Mithika said. The PACJA Executive Director further said Parliamentary debates, sessions, and committee hearings should include voices from Africa and the global south in general to ensure perspectives from affected countries are considered and shape the EU policies. The meeting has also said EU parliaments must push for trade and investment agreements that promote shared prosperity rather than exploitative relationships."

"CGIAR launches portfolio to tackle global food, climate challenges",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/,2025-04-09T15:35:25+03:00,"CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio,Climate Change","CGIAR has launched its 2025–2030 Research Portfolio Tuesday unveiling a blueprint to reshape global food, water and land systems amid escalating hunger, climate change and inequality. The new portfolio unveiled at the inaugural CGIAR Science Week in Nairobi is designed not just to adapt to today’s pressing needs but to actively shape a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. The new phase of CGIAR action is more collaborative, focused, and ambitious, building on 50 years of science expertise and its extensive partner networks. Speaking during the launch at the United Nations Complex in Gigirin Nairobi, CGIAR Executive Managing Director, Ismahane Elouafi noted that the new portfolio unites the work of all CGIAR Centers into a single strategic platform comprising of eight science programs, one scaling program and four accelerators which reflects a renewed commitment to delivering transformative solutions . “The portfolio is more than a set of programs and accelerators. It is a unified platform designed for impact. It reflects our renewed commitment to not only improving productivity but also nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and social equity,” said Elouafi. According to Elouafi, the Research Portfolio is a direct response to global calls for action by world leaders, science experts, and farmers on the frontline of today’s agricultural crises. Anchored in frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 2025 Paris Agreement, and the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Research Portfolio reflects the reality that today’s food systems can no longer deliver nutrition, equity, or sustainability for our growing populations. The Research Portfolio aims to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and resilience they need to thrive, with smallholder farmers in the Global South being the most affected. With a global workforce of over 10,000 staff across 80+ countries and a wide network of partnerships, CGIAR is uniquely positioned to coordinate a global response powered by pioneering agricultural science. On her part, CGIAR Chief Scientist Sandra Milach highlighted that the Research Portfolio is established around Science Programs focused on critical needs, a Scaling for Impact Program to ensure innovation is widely adopted, and accelerators to boost both research and technology adoption. “50 years ago, we turned to science for solutions,” said Milach, “The CGIAR centers were created to help farmers produce food, and together with our partners, have since saved millions of lives in Africa and Asia. However, the world is different now. We are facing climate change, biodiversity loss and new conflicts. Once again, we will need to build capabilities to be able to address these new problems. Today, we must develop research that can truly address these issues.” Combined, these components aggregate expertise and partnerships around high-priority targets to collectively deliver scalable solutions that tackle the most pressing global agricultural challenges. The stakeholders know best A key strength of the Research Portfolio is its collaborative design developed alongside key
stakeholders such as national agricultural research institutions and the farmers themselves. Through global “Listening Sessions” and consultations with governments, regional bodies, national research institutions, and local farming communities, CGIAR ensures the portfolio reflects real-world needs and responds to priorities at national,
regional, and global levels. The design also builds on analysis of CGIAR’s cutting-edge innovations and technologies that factor in current discourse on global agricultural needs and challenges from shifting diets and demographics to climate volatility and geopolitical shocks. The result is a forward-looking research and innovation agenda that integrates science, policy, and
partnerships to achieve lasting impact. CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio will benefit food, land and water systems across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by accelerating agricultural productivity growth, leading to better-functioning markets, strengthened livelihoods and new job and income opportunities for workers in the agrifood system, especially women. It builds on a solid foundation of existing work while expanding into emerging areas of science with potential for impact, helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty while supporting low-income producers and consumers for the decades to come. Stakeholders know best  At the heart of the new strategy is a collaborative design process informed by global “Listening Sessions,” ensuring that innovations are locally relevant and globally scalable. The inclusion of accelerators also signals CGIAR’s intention to move research beyond experimentation into real-world application bridging the gap between science and adoption.

Speaking at the World Chambers Federation Africa Summit 2025, President Ruto said called on the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) through its devolved chapters to champion pro-business reforms, eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks in order to support local entrepreneurs in the 47 counties. “To encourage this, we are developing a County Ease of Doing Business Index to drive healthy competition, accountability, and progress,” he stated. Among processes the government is seeking to support counties in adopting, is the Unified Business Permit which has since been rolled out in Nairobi County. According to the President, chambers of commerce are critical in bringing proactive and solutions-oriented perspective which foster economic growth through public and private sector linkages. President Ruto further highlighted the role of chambers in helping businesses navigate risk, unlock
opportunities, and expand into global markets. “In Kenya, we fully embrace this transformation. In 2022, 41pc of our exports were destined for African countries. Our manufacturers and tech start-ups are expanding across the region, demonstrating our strong conviction that Kenya’s and Africa’s economic fortunes lie in intra-African trade and cooperation,” he added. Kenya backs its investments in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and border posts to markets, fibre-optic networks, and renewable energy to continue supporting enterprise in order to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost exports and enhance economic growth."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."

According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects.

President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

This follows the lifting of a nine year moratorium which was effected on November 17, 2015. According to CBK the moratorium was meant to strengthen the banking sector after a series of governance, risk management and operational challenges. “Since then, significant strides have been made in strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for Kenya’s banking sector. Notably there have been mergers and acquisitions by existing players and entry of new domestic and foreign strategic investors into the sector,” said CBK. However CBK says new licences will only be issued to new banks with core capital of Ksh 10 billion as per the Business Law Act 2024. “Following the lifting of the moratorium, new entrants to the Kenyan banking sector must will be required to demonstrate that they can meet the enhanced minimum capital requirement of Ksh 10 billion,” said CBK. Recent acquisition in the sector include sale of National Bank of Kenya (NBK) by KCB Group to Nigeria’s Access Bank Plc which the regulator approved this month."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

KALRO unveils Ksh.1.3B facility to develop wheat varieties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kalro-unveils-ksh-1-3b-facility-to-develop-wheat-varieties/,2025-04-14T12:19:46+03:00,"Agriculture,wheat production","The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has inaugurated a new Ksh 1.3 billion ($1m) research facility which is expected to boost wheat production in the country. The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"

In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

Speaking during the launch of the system, National Treasury Principal Secretary Dr. Chris Kiptoo said eRITS which is built on KRA’s Enterprise Integration Platform, Gava Connect is to set to streamline compliance for the real estate sector from a technology perspective. “The government is committed to ensuring that the tax system remains fair and that compliance is as seamless as possible. With eRITS, we are moving towards a smarter, more efficient tax system that benefits everyone,” said Kiptoo. According to KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga the system is a voluntary compliance tool that aims to support and enhance tax compliance among rental property owners and agents. “eRITS is designed to enable seamless integration with the KRA ecosystem for purposes of tax computation, filing, and payment; and is accessible through the Gava Connect API portal for system-to-system integration, and as a service through the eCitizen platform. The intention is to augment voluntary compliance within the
sector while reducing administrative burdens associated with taxation.” he stated. The Monthly Rental Income (MRI) which was introduced in 2016 is applicable to landlords earning between Ksh 288,000 and Ksh 15 million annually. The MRI tax rate was reduced from 10pc to 7.5pc, from 1st January 2024, demonstrating the Government’s
commitment to easing the burden on taxation among taxpayers. In the last financial year 2023/2024, tax revenues collected through MRI stood at Ksh 14.4 billion, translating to a 5.2pc year on year growth compared to a collection of Ksh 13.6 billion and Ksh 12.3 billion in the previous financial years."
CBK warns of US tariff consequences as shilling holds firm,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cbk-warns-of-us-tariff-consequences-as-shilling-holds-firm/,2025-04-10T11:50:35+03:00,,"Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has dismissed claims of currency manipulation, attributing the shilling’s stability to targeted policy interventions and prudent monetary management. CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

This has resulted in an uncoordinated development agenda between the global North and South. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director Dr Mithika Mwenda says incoherent policies can lead to unintended consequences like funding green initiatives while investing in fossil fuels, tightening migration policies and promoting labor mobility policies. According to the Climate Finance Initiative report dubbed Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa 2024, Climate financing for Africa grew by 48pc to USD 44 billion in 2021/22. However, this is only a quarter of what is required to realize its 2030 goals. Experts say that climate action, economic growth and social policies should be designed to strengthen each other rather than creating new vulnerabilities and gaps. Addressing a meeting convened by the European Union Parliament, Dr. Mwenda urged the European Parliament to engage transparently with the global south to ensure commitments are met and financing is predictable and easily accessible. Mithika noted that the Global Gateway Initiative, which targets to mobilize up to €300 billion in investments through a Team Europe approach, should be structured in a manner that enhances global north-south relations. “This is in addition to the Global Gateway initiative, aiming to “enable African countries to integrate their raw materials and resources into sustainable global value chains” by 2030. While, for instance, 63pc of the world’s cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, without mentioning other global south countries providing critical Raw Minerals, it is the best opportunity to advance a just, equitable and inclusive transition.” Dr. Mithika said. The PACJA Executive Director further said Parliamentary debates, sessions, and committee hearings should include voices from Africa and the global south in general to ensure perspectives from affected countries are considered and shape the EU policies. The meeting has also said EU parliaments must push for trade and investment agreements that promote shared prosperity rather than exploitative relationships."

"CGIAR launches portfolio to tackle global food, climate challenges",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/,2025-04-09T15:35:25+03:00,"CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio,Climate Change","CGIAR has launched its 2025–2030 Research Portfolio Tuesday unveiling a blueprint to reshape global food, water and land systems amid escalating hunger, climate change and inequality. The new portfolio unveiled at the inaugural CGIAR Science Week in Nairobi is designed not just to adapt to today’s pressing needs but to actively shape a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. The new phase of CGIAR action is more collaborative, focused, and ambitious, building on 50 years of science expertise and its extensive partner networks. Speaking during the launch at the United Nations Complex in Gigirin Nairobi, CGIAR Executive Managing Director, Ismahane Elouafi noted that the new portfolio unites the work of all CGIAR Centers into a single strategic platform comprising of eight science programs, one scaling program and four accelerators which reflects a renewed commitment to delivering transformative solutions . “The portfolio is more than a set of programs and accelerators. It is a unified platform designed for impact. It reflects our renewed commitment to not only improving productivity but also nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and social equity,” said Elouafi. According to Elouafi, the Research Portfolio is a direct response to global calls for action by world leaders, science experts, and farmers on the frontline of today’s agricultural crises. Anchored in frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 2025 Paris Agreement, and the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Research Portfolio reflects the reality that today’s food systems can no longer deliver nutrition, equity, or sustainability for our growing populations. The Research Portfolio aims to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and resilience they need to thrive, with smallholder farmers in the Global South being the most affected. With a global workforce of over 10,000 staff across 80+ countries and a wide network of partnerships, CGIAR is uniquely positioned to coordinate a global response powered by pioneering agricultural science. On her part, CGIAR Chief Scientist Sandra Milach highlighted that the Research Portfolio is established around Science Programs focused on critical needs, a Scaling for Impact Program to ensure innovation is widely adopted, and accelerators to boost both research and technology adoption. “50 years ago, we turned to science for solutions,” said Milach, “The CGIAR centers were created to help farmers produce food, and together with our partners, have since saved millions of lives in Africa and Asia. However, the world is different now. We are facing climate change, biodiversity loss and new conflicts. Once again, we will need to build capabilities to be able to address these new problems. Today, we must develop research that can truly address these issues.” Combined, these components aggregate expertise and partnerships around high-priority targets to collectively deliver scalable solutions that tackle the most pressing global agricultural challenges. The stakeholders know best A key strength of the Research Portfolio is its collaborative design developed alongside key
stakeholders such as national agricultural research institutions and the farmers themselves. Through global “Listening Sessions” and consultations with governments, regional bodies, national research institutions, and local farming communities, CGIAR ensures the portfolio reflects real-world needs and responds to priorities at national,
regional, and global levels. The design also builds on analysis of CGIAR’s cutting-edge innovations and technologies that factor in current discourse on global agricultural needs and challenges from shifting diets and demographics to climate volatility and geopolitical shocks. The result is a forward-looking research and innovation agenda that integrates science, policy, and
partnerships to achieve lasting impact. CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio will benefit food, land and water systems across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by accelerating agricultural productivity growth, leading to better-functioning markets, strengthened livelihoods and new job and income opportunities for workers in the agrifood system, especially women. It builds on a solid foundation of existing work while expanding into emerging areas of science with potential for impact, helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty while supporting low-income producers and consumers for the decades to come. Stakeholders know best  At the heart of the new strategy is a collaborative design process informed by global “Listening Sessions,” ensuring that innovations are locally relevant and globally scalable. The inclusion of accelerators also signals CGIAR’s intention to move research beyond experimentation into real-world application bridging the gap between science and adoption.

Speaking at the World Chambers Federation Africa Summit 2025, President Ruto said called on the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) through its devolved chapters to champion pro-business reforms, eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks in order to support local entrepreneurs in the 47 counties. “To encourage this, we are developing a County Ease of Doing Business Index to drive healthy competition, accountability, and progress,” he stated. Among processes the government is seeking to support counties in adopting, is the Unified Business Permit which has since been rolled out in Nairobi County. According to the President, chambers of commerce are critical in bringing proactive and solutions-oriented perspective which foster economic growth through public and private sector linkages. President Ruto further highlighted the role of chambers in helping businesses navigate risk, unlock
opportunities, and expand into global markets. “In Kenya, we fully embrace this transformation. In 2022, 41pc of our exports were destined for African countries. Our manufacturers and tech start-ups are expanding across the region, demonstrating our strong conviction that Kenya’s and Africa’s economic fortunes lie in intra-African trade and cooperation,” he added. Kenya backs its investments in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and border posts to markets, fibre-optic networks, and renewable energy to continue supporting enterprise in order to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost exports and enhance economic growth."

Kenya’s retail market evolves as Adidas originals opens at Westgate Mall,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-retail-market-evolves-as-adidas-originals-opens-at-westgate-mall/,2025-04-07T17:31:50+03:00,"Adidas,Westgate Mall","Kenya continues to position itself as a key destination for international brands, with the latest entrant being Adidas Originals. The globally recognized sports and lifestyle brand has officially expanded its presence in Kenya with a new store at Westgate Mall in Westlands, introduced by WAMA International Group. This move reflects a broader trend of global brands entering or expanding in Kenya. Companies such as Nike, Puma, and Levi’s already have a presence in the country, capitalizing on Kenya’s growing middle class and increasing consumer demand for high-quality lifestyle and fashion products. Westgate Mall, which hosts over 80 stores, has become a prime location for such brands looking to establish a foothold in the region. The rise of Westgate Mall as a premier retail hub is particularly significant given its history. The mall was the site of a tragic terror attack in 2013, an event that tested Nairobi’s resilience. However, the mall has since been rebuilt and re-imagined, emerging as a symbol of strength and economic revival. Today, it stands as one of Nairobi’s leading shopping destinations, attracting both global brands and local entrepreneurs eager to tap into Kenya’s dynamic retail market. Kenya’s fashion industry has experienced significant growth, influenced by both international and local trends. While global brands continue to expand their presence, the local market is highly competitive, with both original and non-original brands vying for consumer attention. Counterfeit products, often sold at lower prices, present a challenge for premium brands like Adidas, which emphasize quality, authenticity, and innovation. At the same time, Kenya’s local manufacturing sector is working to carve out a space in the fashion industry. Designers and entrepreneurs are pushing for “Made in Kenya” products, with a focus on sustainable fashion, locally sourced materials, and unique African-inspired designs. However, they face stiff competition from established global brands, both in terms of brand recognition and consumer preference. WAMA International, a retail company with over 30 stores across different regions, says it has ambitious expansion plans in East Africa. The opening of Adidas Originals in Nairobi underscores the confidence international investors have in Kenya’s retail market, driven by a strong consumer base and a steadily growing economy. The new Adidas Originals store aims to enhance the shopping experience with a curated selection of lifestyle footwear, apparel, and accessories for both men and women. The store’s strategic location within Westgate Mall allows it to tap into the mall’s high foot traffic and diverse customer base. The grand opening on April 4 was marked by a lively launch event featuring live entertainment, DJ performances, sneaker customization, and a celebration of local culture. The event reflected Adidas’ commitment to creativity, inclusion, and sustainability while aligning with Nairobi’s vibrant urban scene. As global brands tailor their offerings to local preferences, Adidas Originals’ entry into the Kenyan market follows a similar approach. Companies like Carrefour and LC Waikiki have successfully adapted their business models to resonate with Kenyan consumers, reinforcing the country’s growing reputation as a lucrative retail destination. “It has been a great experience to partner with WAMA International Group and bring the first adidas Originals standalone store to Nairobi. As a brand, we are committed to expanding our presence in Africa and making a positive impact in the communities we serve,” said Brett Burgess, Senior Director, Africa Export, EM South. Ismael Elmahdy, Head of Retail at WAMA International Group, shared his enthusiasm, stating, “We are thrilled to launch our first Adidas Originals store in East Africa. This marks a significant milestone in our expansion strategy, and we look forward to offering Kenyan consumers world-class products and experiences.” The Adidas Originals store is now open on the first floor of Westgate Mall, Nairobi, joining a growing list of international brands that view Kenya as a strategic market in Africa. Meanwhile, the country’s local fashion industry continues to evolve, balancing tradition, innovation, and competition with global players."
Seafarers to get key document to expand job opportunities ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/seafarers-to-get-key-document-to-expand-job-opportunities/,2025-04-07T15:28:19+03:00,,"The government is in the process of making Seafarers Identification Documents which will enable seafarers to work in foreign countries, according to Labour Cabinet Secretary Dr. Alfred Mutua. Speaking at an induction workshop for the Seafarers’ and Wages Council in Kilifi County, Dr Mutua said lack of the document make it for local seafarers to seek carriers in other territories despite numerous available opportunities. “Just like to any other professional another critical issue to Seafarers is the Seafarers Identity Document (SID). Without this document, securing opportunities to work outside the country in the maritime sector is extremely difficult. I will ensure that those without it receive the necessary support to obtain it to unlock access to job opportunities abroad,” said Dr Mutua. He said the maritime sector offers a wide range of employment opportunities in areas such as fishing, sea freight and cruise ships which they youth could explore. This comes as the government commits to address unique challenges faced by seafarers with the establishment of the Seafarers’ Wages Council. “For far too long, the men and women who power the maritime sector, our seafarers have faced numerous challenges including precarious employment conditions, low wages and inadequate social protection,” Mutua said. However, Mutua said one of the major challenges in seafarer training is the lack of dedicated training vessels and therefore urged ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to ensure they are fully equipped with the necessary skills upon completing their courses. “The training which is currently conducted is not real training unless there’s practicals. I therefore ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to prepare them for employment,” he said. The wages council is mandated with providing economic policy interventions as well as job creation by ensuring the existence of a well-regulated and attractive working environment which will encourage more Kenyans to pursue careers in the maritime industry. The council will also ensure fair wages and decent working conditions to seafarers as per the Employment Act, enhance Kenya’s competitiveness as a maritime nation by attracting the training skill maritime profession, strengthen the protection of seafarer’s rights by promoting their welfare and dignity and also enforce a social dialogue among employers, employees and relevant government institutions to maintain industrial harmony in the maritime sector. The CS urged the council to adopt best practices from successful maritime nations and continuously engage in capacity-building initiatives. “To discharge your mandate, you should strive to carry out comparative learning in other successful countries and engage in continuous capacity building which is the pillar of providing a forum for members to discuss, consult and make crucial decisions while equipping them with adequate governance skills, he noted."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."
Kenya banks on partnerships to cut greenhouse gases in new NDC framework,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-banks-on-partnerships-to-cut-greenhouse-gases-in-new-ndc-framework/,2025-05-01T18:28:52+03:00,"greenhouse gas emissions,Nationally Determined Contributions","Kenya will spend close to seven trillion shillings to implement a raft of measures aimed at cutting down its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."

Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Leading a high-level government delegation, President Ruto participated in productive discussions with his Chinese counterpart, marking a new era in the Kenya-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. According to Statehouse, the talks resulted in significant diplomatic and economic breakthroughs, enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, infrastructure, and sustainable development. “Discussions between the two leaders focused on key priorities such as trade expansion, investment promotion, and development cooperation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects.

This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion). These agreements cover key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure, and are expected to create over 28,000 jobs across the country. Notable projects include a Special Economic Zone in Kilifi County (expected to create 5,000 jobs) and manufacturing expansions in Machakos, Murang’a, and Mombasa.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

During the ceremony to present the certification to Auditor General Nancy Gathungu, KEBS Managing Director Esther Ngari highlighted that the standard provides a crucial framework for safeguarding sensitive information. Ngari stated that the achievement results from enhancing operational excellence, ensuring that financial statements and audit records are credible, secure, and readily accessible when needed. “On behalf of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, its Management, Certification Body, and the entire staff, I extend our heartfelt congratulations to you for this outstanding achievement. It is a true reflection of your commitment to excellence, transparency, and accountability in public service,” said Ngari. The KEBS Managing Director specifically commended the Office of the Auditor-General for the award, noting its critical role in the nation’s democratic framework. She asserted that the new certification indicates that the Office of the Auditor-General is not only meeting but exceeding international benchmarks in securing information assets, aligning its operations with global standards of public sector governance in the digital age. “The Office of the Auditor-General is entrusted with the immense responsibility of independently auditing and reporting on the management of public resources at both national and county levels. Such a mandate calls not only for institutional integrity but also for robust safeguards around the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information,” she said.

In a world where data has become a vital national asset and cyber threats are increasing in complexity and scale, the KEBS MD believes that the ISMS certification confirms the office’s preparedness to tackle current risks and lead in upholding national security, institutional credibility, and public confidence. “Every day, institutions like this handle substantial volumes of confidential data. Any breach of that information could have far-reaching implications not only for the institution but also for public trust and national stability.

Speaking during a meeting with Iranian business groups, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe noted that Kenya is committed to strengthening bilateral trade ties and ensuring high-quality tea reaches global markets. “Reopening access to Iran’s robust market could be a game changer for tea farmers and the entire tea value chain.” CS Kagwe said. During the meeting the leaders discussions also focused on exploring expanded trade opportunities not only with Iran but across the broader Middle Eastern and Central Asian. The CS was accompanied by the Amb of the Republic of Kenya to the UAE Kenneth Milimo, Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) Holdings Ltd Chair Chege Kirundi and the CEO Wilson Muthaura. The meeting signals Kenya’s renewed diplomatic and economic push to strengthen bilateral ties, ensure stable markets for its agricultural exports, and position Kenyan tea competitively on the global stage. According to Tea Board of Kenya (TBK), during the year 2024, the total earnings from tea amounted to Kshs. 215.21 Billion, out of which Kshs. 181.69 Billion was earned from exports, Kshs. 18.00 Billion from local sales and Kshs. 15.52 Billion from committed stocks. This was an increase of 9% from the marketed value of Kshs. 196.97 Billion recorded in 2023. From the total marketed value, the exports earnings recorded improved performance of 1% (Kshs. 1.12 Billion) to stand at Kshs. 181.69 Billion from Kshs. 180.57 Billion recorded in 2023 attributed to increased export volume by 14% (71.59 Million Kgs) from 522.92 Million Kgs recorded in 2023 to 594.50 Million Kgs. In the same year 2024, Kenya tea was shipped to ninety-six (96) export destinations compared ninety-two (92) in the year 2023. Pakistan maintained its position as the leading export destination for Kenya tea having imported 206.27 Million Kgs, which accounted for 34.7% of the total export volume.  In terms of value, the consignment to Pakistan was worth Kshs. 70 Billion. Other key export destinations for Kenya tea were Egypt whose import volume was 86.90 Million Kgs worth Kshs. 23.96 Billion; UK (57.44 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 16.99 Billion); UAE (30.50 Million Kgs valued at Kshs. 10.27 Billion); Russia (28.46 Million Kgs, Kshs. 7.43 Billion); India (17.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 3.94 Billion); Saudi Arabia (15.92 Million Kgs, Kshs. 6.02 Billion); Yemen (14.13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 5.52 Billion); Iran (13 Million Kgs, Kshs. 4.26 Billion); and China (12.42 Million Kgs, Kshs. 2.73 Billion)."
KUSCCO gets new 11 member board to steer recovery,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kuscco-gets-new-11-member-board-to-steer-recovery/,2025-04-16T21:38:01+03:00,"KUSCCO,Sacco","The government has appointed a new board of directors to oversee recovery of troubled Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (KUSCCO). The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."

The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"
Strategic labour investments to secure jobs during green transition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/strategic-labour-investments-to-secure-jobs-during-green-transition/,2025-04-11T15:03:19+03:00,"employment,green transition","African countries especially those highly dependent on fossil fuels could experience rise in inequality due to job losses resulting from green transition. In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

Speaking during the launch of the system, National Treasury Principal Secretary Dr. Chris Kiptoo said eRITS which is built on KRA’s Enterprise Integration Platform, Gava Connect is to set to streamline compliance for the real estate sector from a technology perspective. “The government is committed to ensuring that the tax system remains fair and that compliance is as seamless as possible. With eRITS, we are moving towards a smarter, more efficient tax system that benefits everyone,” said Kiptoo. According to KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga the system is a voluntary compliance tool that aims to support and enhance tax compliance among rental property owners and agents. “eRITS is designed to enable seamless integration with the KRA ecosystem for purposes of tax computation, filing, and payment; and is accessible through the Gava Connect API portal for system-to-system integration, and as a service through the eCitizen platform. The intention is to augment voluntary compliance within the
sector while reducing administrative burdens associated with taxation.” he stated. The Monthly Rental Income (MRI) which was introduced in 2016 is applicable to landlords earning between Ksh 288,000 and Ksh 15 million annually. The MRI tax rate was reduced from 10pc to 7.5pc, from 1st January 2024, demonstrating the Government’s
commitment to easing the burden on taxation among taxpayers. In the last financial year 2023/2024, tax revenues collected through MRI stood at Ksh 14.4 billion, translating to a 5.2pc year on year growth compared to a collection of Ksh 13.6 billion and Ksh 12.3 billion in the previous financial years."

CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

This has resulted in an uncoordinated development agenda between the global North and South. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director Dr Mithika Mwenda says incoherent policies can lead to unintended consequences like funding green initiatives while investing in fossil fuels, tightening migration policies and promoting labor mobility policies. According to the Climate Finance Initiative report dubbed Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa 2024, Climate financing for Africa grew by 48pc to USD 44 billion in 2021/22. However, this is only a quarter of what is required to realize its 2030 goals. Experts say that climate action, economic growth and social policies should be designed to strengthen each other rather than creating new vulnerabilities and gaps. Addressing a meeting convened by the European Union Parliament, Dr. Mwenda urged the European Parliament to engage transparently with the global south to ensure commitments are met and financing is predictable and easily accessible. Mithika noted that the Global Gateway Initiative, which targets to mobilize up to €300 billion in investments through a Team Europe approach, should be structured in a manner that enhances global north-south relations. “This is in addition to the Global Gateway initiative, aiming to “enable African countries to integrate their raw materials and resources into sustainable global value chains” by 2030. While, for instance, 63pc of the world’s cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, without mentioning other global south countries providing critical Raw Minerals, it is the best opportunity to advance a just, equitable and inclusive transition.” Dr. Mithika said. The PACJA Executive Director further said Parliamentary debates, sessions, and committee hearings should include voices from Africa and the global south in general to ensure perspectives from affected countries are considered and shape the EU policies. The meeting has also said EU parliaments must push for trade and investment agreements that promote shared prosperity rather than exploitative relationships."

"CGIAR launches portfolio to tackle global food, climate challenges",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/,2025-04-09T15:35:25+03:00,"CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio,Climate Change","CGIAR has launched its 2025–2030 Research Portfolio Tuesday unveiling a blueprint to reshape global food, water and land systems amid escalating hunger, climate change and inequality. The new portfolio unveiled at the inaugural CGIAR Science Week in Nairobi is designed not just to adapt to today’s pressing needs but to actively shape a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. The new phase of CGIAR action is more collaborative, focused, and ambitious, building on 50 years of science expertise and its extensive partner networks. Speaking during the launch at the United Nations Complex in Gigirin Nairobi, CGIAR Executive Managing Director, Ismahane Elouafi noted that the new portfolio unites the work of all CGIAR Centers into a single strategic platform comprising of eight science programs, one scaling program and four accelerators which reflects a renewed commitment to delivering transformative solutions . “The portfolio is more than a set of programs and accelerators. It is a unified platform designed for impact. It reflects our renewed commitment to not only improving productivity but also nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and social equity,” said Elouafi. According to Elouafi, the Research Portfolio is a direct response to global calls for action by world leaders, science experts, and farmers on the frontline of today’s agricultural crises. Anchored in frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 2025 Paris Agreement, and the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Research Portfolio reflects the reality that today’s food systems can no longer deliver nutrition, equity, or sustainability for our growing populations. The Research Portfolio aims to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and resilience they need to thrive, with smallholder farmers in the Global South being the most affected. With a global workforce of over 10,000 staff across 80+ countries and a wide network of partnerships, CGIAR is uniquely positioned to coordinate a global response powered by pioneering agricultural science. On her part, CGIAR Chief Scientist Sandra Milach highlighted that the Research Portfolio is established around Science Programs focused on critical needs, a Scaling for Impact Program to ensure innovation is widely adopted, and accelerators to boost both research and technology adoption. “50 years ago, we turned to science for solutions,” said Milach, “The CGIAR centers were created to help farmers produce food, and together with our partners, have since saved millions of lives in Africa and Asia. However, the world is different now. We are facing climate change, biodiversity loss and new conflicts. Once again, we will need to build capabilities to be able to address these new problems. Today, we must develop research that can truly address these issues.” Combined, these components aggregate expertise and partnerships around high-priority targets to collectively deliver scalable solutions that tackle the most pressing global agricultural challenges. The stakeholders know best A key strength of the Research Portfolio is its collaborative design developed alongside key
stakeholders such as national agricultural research institutions and the farmers themselves. Through global “Listening Sessions” and consultations with governments, regional bodies, national research institutions, and local farming communities, CGIAR ensures the portfolio reflects real-world needs and responds to priorities at national,
regional, and global levels. The design also builds on analysis of CGIAR’s cutting-edge innovations and technologies that factor in current discourse on global agricultural needs and challenges from shifting diets and demographics to climate volatility and geopolitical shocks. The result is a forward-looking research and innovation agenda that integrates science, policy, and
partnerships to achieve lasting impact. CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio will benefit food, land and water systems across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by accelerating agricultural productivity growth, leading to better-functioning markets, strengthened livelihoods and new job and income opportunities for workers in the agrifood system, especially women. It builds on a solid foundation of existing work while expanding into emerging areas of science with potential for impact, helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty while supporting low-income producers and consumers for the decades to come. Stakeholders know best  At the heart of the new strategy is a collaborative design process informed by global “Listening Sessions,” ensuring that innovations are locally relevant and globally scalable. The inclusion of accelerators also signals CGIAR’s intention to move research beyond experimentation into real-world application bridging the gap between science and adoption.

Speaking at the World Chambers Federation Africa Summit 2025, President Ruto said called on the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) through its devolved chapters to champion pro-business reforms, eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks in order to support local entrepreneurs in the 47 counties. “To encourage this, we are developing a County Ease of Doing Business Index to drive healthy competition, accountability, and progress,” he stated. Among processes the government is seeking to support counties in adopting, is the Unified Business Permit which has since been rolled out in Nairobi County. According to the President, chambers of commerce are critical in bringing proactive and solutions-oriented perspective which foster economic growth through public and private sector linkages. President Ruto further highlighted the role of chambers in helping businesses navigate risk, unlock
opportunities, and expand into global markets. “In Kenya, we fully embrace this transformation. In 2022, 41pc of our exports were destined for African countries. Our manufacturers and tech start-ups are expanding across the region, demonstrating our strong conviction that Kenya’s and Africa’s economic fortunes lie in intra-African trade and cooperation,” he added. Kenya backs its investments in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and border posts to markets, fibre-optic networks, and renewable energy to continue supporting enterprise in order to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost exports and enhance economic growth."

Kenya’s retail market evolves as Adidas originals opens at Westgate Mall,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-retail-market-evolves-as-adidas-originals-opens-at-westgate-mall/,2025-04-07T17:31:50+03:00,"Adidas,Westgate Mall","Kenya continues to position itself as a key destination for international brands, with the latest entrant being Adidas Originals. The globally recognized sports and lifestyle brand has officially expanded its presence in Kenya with a new store at Westgate Mall in Westlands, introduced by WAMA International Group. This move reflects a broader trend of global brands entering or expanding in Kenya. Companies such as Nike, Puma, and Levi’s already have a presence in the country, capitalizing on Kenya’s growing middle class and increasing consumer demand for high-quality lifestyle and fashion products. Westgate Mall, which hosts over 80 stores, has become a prime location for such brands looking to establish a foothold in the region. The rise of Westgate Mall as a premier retail hub is particularly significant given its history. The mall was the site of a tragic terror attack in 2013, an event that tested Nairobi’s resilience. However, the mall has since been rebuilt and re-imagined, emerging as a symbol of strength and economic revival. Today, it stands as one of Nairobi’s leading shopping destinations, attracting both global brands and local entrepreneurs eager to tap into Kenya’s dynamic retail market. Kenya’s fashion industry has experienced significant growth, influenced by both international and local trends. While global brands continue to expand their presence, the local market is highly competitive, with both original and non-original brands vying for consumer attention. Counterfeit products, often sold at lower prices, present a challenge for premium brands like Adidas, which emphasize quality, authenticity, and innovation. At the same time, Kenya’s local manufacturing sector is working to carve out a space in the fashion industry. Designers and entrepreneurs are pushing for “Made in Kenya” products, with a focus on sustainable fashion, locally sourced materials, and unique African-inspired designs. However, they face stiff competition from established global brands, both in terms of brand recognition and consumer preference. WAMA International, a retail company with over 30 stores across different regions, says it has ambitious expansion plans in East Africa. The opening of Adidas Originals in Nairobi underscores the confidence international investors have in Kenya’s retail market, driven by a strong consumer base and a steadily growing economy. The new Adidas Originals store aims to enhance the shopping experience with a curated selection of lifestyle footwear, apparel, and accessories for both men and women. The store’s strategic location within Westgate Mall allows it to tap into the mall’s high foot traffic and diverse customer base. The grand opening on April 4 was marked by a lively launch event featuring live entertainment, DJ performances, sneaker customization, and a celebration of local culture. The event reflected Adidas’ commitment to creativity, inclusion, and sustainability while aligning with Nairobi’s vibrant urban scene. As global brands tailor their offerings to local preferences, Adidas Originals’ entry into the Kenyan market follows a similar approach. Companies like Carrefour and LC Waikiki have successfully adapted their business models to resonate with Kenyan consumers, reinforcing the country’s growing reputation as a lucrative retail destination. “It has been a great experience to partner with WAMA International Group and bring the first adidas Originals standalone store to Nairobi. As a brand, we are committed to expanding our presence in Africa and making a positive impact in the communities we serve,” said Brett Burgess, Senior Director, Africa Export, EM South. Ismael Elmahdy, Head of Retail at WAMA International Group, shared his enthusiasm, stating, “We are thrilled to launch our first Adidas Originals store in East Africa. This marks a significant milestone in our expansion strategy, and we look forward to offering Kenyan consumers world-class products and experiences.” The Adidas Originals store is now open on the first floor of Westgate Mall, Nairobi, joining a growing list of international brands that view Kenya as a strategic market in Africa. Meanwhile, the country’s local fashion industry continues to evolve, balancing tradition, innovation, and competition with global players."
Seafarers to get key document to expand job opportunities ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/seafarers-to-get-key-document-to-expand-job-opportunities/,2025-04-07T15:28:19+03:00,,"The government is in the process of making Seafarers Identification Documents which will enable seafarers to work in foreign countries, according to Labour Cabinet Secretary Dr. Alfred Mutua. Speaking at an induction workshop for the Seafarers’ and Wages Council in Kilifi County, Dr Mutua said lack of the document make it for local seafarers to seek carriers in other territories despite numerous available opportunities. “Just like to any other professional another critical issue to Seafarers is the Seafarers Identity Document (SID). Without this document, securing opportunities to work outside the country in the maritime sector is extremely difficult. I will ensure that those without it receive the necessary support to obtain it to unlock access to job opportunities abroad,” said Dr Mutua. He said the maritime sector offers a wide range of employment opportunities in areas such as fishing, sea freight and cruise ships which they youth could explore. This comes as the government commits to address unique challenges faced by seafarers with the establishment of the Seafarers’ Wages Council. “For far too long, the men and women who power the maritime sector, our seafarers have faced numerous challenges including precarious employment conditions, low wages and inadequate social protection,” Mutua said. However, Mutua said one of the major challenges in seafarer training is the lack of dedicated training vessels and therefore urged ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to ensure they are fully equipped with the necessary skills upon completing their courses. “The training which is currently conducted is not real training unless there’s practicals. I therefore ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to prepare them for employment,” he said. The wages council is mandated with providing economic policy interventions as well as job creation by ensuring the existence of a well-regulated and attractive working environment which will encourage more Kenyans to pursue careers in the maritime industry. The council will also ensure fair wages and decent working conditions to seafarers as per the Employment Act, enhance Kenya’s competitiveness as a maritime nation by attracting the training skill maritime profession, strengthen the protection of seafarer’s rights by promoting their welfare and dignity and also enforce a social dialogue among employers, employees and relevant government institutions to maintain industrial harmony in the maritime sector. The CS urged the council to adopt best practices from successful maritime nations and continuously engage in capacity-building initiatives. “To discharge your mandate, you should strive to carry out comparative learning in other successful countries and engage in continuous capacity building which is the pillar of providing a forum for members to discuss, consult and make crucial decisions while equipping them with adequate governance skills, he noted."

These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."
Livestock e-voucher vaccination piloted in Uasin Gishu County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/livestock-e-voucher-vaccination-piloted-in-uasin-gishu-county/,2025-05-05T15:30:50+03:00,,"Uasin Gishu County has become the first devolved unit in Kenya to pilot an e-voucher-based animal vaccination program. Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."
Kagwe hints at allowing tea farmers to sell directly to buyers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kagwe-hints-at-allowing-tea-farmers-to-sell-directly-to-buyers/,2025-05-02T17:51:21+03:00,"Agriculture,tea","Kenya tea farmers could soon be allowed to sell their produce directly to international buyers in what Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says is expected to improve earnings. According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent.

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Leading a high-level government delegation, President Ruto participated in productive discussions with his Chinese counterpart, marking a new era in the Kenya-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. According to Statehouse, the talks resulted in significant diplomatic and economic breakthroughs, enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, infrastructure, and sustainable development. “Discussions between the two leaders focused on key priorities such as trade expansion, investment promotion, and development cooperation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects. The agreements include investments for the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway to Naivasha (Phase II) and from Naivasha to Malaba (Phase III). Additionally, they encompass the expansion and dualing of the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau Summit–Malaba highway, the Kiambu-Northern Bypass, the Eldoret Bypass, and the construction of the Nithi Bridge. “This cooperation cements Kenya’s role as a key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional logistics partner, while integrating East Africa’s transportation network and enhancing intra-regional trade,” he said. Furthermore, the Statehouse spokesperson confirmed that China has opened avenues for increased private sector investment, which will be directed towards the listed infrastructure projects through Public-Private Partnerships, thus accelerating development and deepening economic ties.

Additionally, both countries agreed to enhance cooperation in road and water infrastructure,” he said. In support of Kenya’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, China pledged grants to improve hospital infrastructure and committed to private sector investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing. A Framework Agreement on Economic Partnership for Shared Development was also signed, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive trade deal. This agreement aims to expand market access for Kenyan exports, including tea, coffee, avocado, macadamia, and other agricultural products. “China commended and expressed support for Kenya’s ongoing efforts on liability management through sustained economic reforms to create the fiscal space necessary for sustainable development,” he stated. “The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation in green energy, innovation, tourism, and regional peace. President Ruto acknowledged China’s support for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region, while President Xi lauded Kenya’s contribution to the UN Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Both leaders emphasised the importance of a peaceful and rules-based international order,” Mohamed added. During the Kenya-China Private Sector Roundtable and Business Forum on Wednesday, President Ruto oversaw the signing of investment agreements worth approximately KSh137 billion (USD 1.06 billion). These agreements cover key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure, and are expected to create over 28,000 jobs across the country.

Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

During the ceremony to present the certification to Auditor General Nancy Gathungu, KEBS Managing Director Esther Ngari highlighted that the standard provides a crucial framework for safeguarding sensitive information. Ngari stated that the achievement results from enhancing operational excellence, ensuring that financial statements and audit records are credible, secure, and readily accessible when needed. “On behalf of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, its Management, Certification Body, and the entire staff, I extend our heartfelt congratulations to you for this outstanding achievement. It is a true reflection of your commitment to excellence, transparency, and accountability in public service,” said Ngari. The KEBS Managing Director specifically commended the Office of the Auditor-General for the award, noting its critical role in the nation’s democratic framework. She asserted that the new certification indicates that the Office of the Auditor-General is not only meeting but exceeding international benchmarks in securing information assets, aligning its operations with global standards of public sector governance in the digital age. “The Office of the Auditor-General is entrusted with the immense responsibility of independently auditing and reporting on the management of public resources at both national and county levels. Such a mandate calls not only for institutional integrity but also for robust safeguards around the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information,” she said. According to Ngari, the certification directly supports the Office of the Auditor-General in adopting secure, technology-driven systems that will enhance operational efficiency. In a world where data has become a vital national asset and cyber threats are increasing in complexity and scale, the KEBS MD believes that the ISMS certification confirms the office’s preparedness to tackle current risks and lead in upholding national security, institutional credibility, and public confidence. “Every day, institutions like this handle substantial volumes of confidential data. Any breach of that information could have far-reaching implications not only for the institution but also for public trust and national stability. By attaining this globally recognised certification, this office has demonstrated its commitment to safeguarding sensitive data, protecting its stakeholders, and affirming its place as a leading audit institution not only in Africa but worldwide,” she explained. Ngari added that KEBS will continue to assist institutions like the Office of the Auditor-General through activities such as annual surveillance audits and technical support, as well as helping to identify opportunities for continual improvement to ensure they remain at the forefront of excellence in public sector auditing and information security.

The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa. Chibule and Mupe said that the blasts were emitting dust that had affected the health of residents with many suffering from breathing problems and respiratory diseases. “Some companies have operated for more than 30 years but they have not even sponsored students to go to school. When the blasts happen, stones are thrown in the air and land on people’s homes causing destruction,” said Kenga."

The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"
Strategic labour investments to secure jobs during green transition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/strategic-labour-investments-to-secure-jobs-during-green-transition/,2025-04-11T15:03:19+03:00,"employment,green transition","African countries especially those highly dependent on fossil fuels could experience rise in inequality due to job losses resulting from green transition. In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

Speaking during the launch of the system, National Treasury Principal Secretary Dr. Chris Kiptoo said eRITS which is built on KRA’s Enterprise Integration Platform, Gava Connect is to set to streamline compliance for the real estate sector from a technology perspective. “The government is committed to ensuring that the tax system remains fair and that compliance is as seamless as possible. With eRITS, we are moving towards a smarter, more efficient tax system that benefits everyone,” said Kiptoo. According to KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga the system is a voluntary compliance tool that aims to support and enhance tax compliance among rental property owners and agents. “eRITS is designed to enable seamless integration with the KRA ecosystem for purposes of tax computation, filing, and payment; and is accessible through the Gava Connect API portal for system-to-system integration, and as a service through the eCitizen platform. The intention is to augment voluntary compliance within the
sector while reducing administrative burdens associated with taxation.” he stated. The Monthly Rental Income (MRI) which was introduced in 2016 is applicable to landlords earning between Ksh 288,000 and Ksh 15 million annually. The MRI tax rate was reduced from 10pc to 7.5pc, from 1st January 2024, demonstrating the Government’s
commitment to easing the burden on taxation among taxpayers. In the last financial year 2023/2024, tax revenues collected through MRI stood at Ksh 14.4 billion, translating to a 5.2pc year on year growth compared to a collection of Ksh 13.6 billion and Ksh 12.3 billion in the previous financial years."
CBK warns of US tariff consequences as shilling holds firm,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cbk-warns-of-us-tariff-consequences-as-shilling-holds-firm/,2025-04-10T11:50:35+03:00,,"Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has dismissed claims of currency manipulation, attributing the shilling’s stability to targeted policy interventions and prudent monetary management. CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

During the Global AI Summit on Africa in Kigali, Rwanda, 54 African became signatories to Africa Declaration on Artificial Intelligence which will see the establishment of Africa AI Fund. “The launch of the Africa Declaration of Artificial Intelligence marks a milestone in shaping Africa’s AI governance and innovation landscape. This Declaration is timely, as Africa’s AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving but remains fragmented and underfunded,” said Shikoh Gitau, CEO of Qhala. African becomes the latest region to unveil funding to support AI research and development. In February this year, the European Commission unveiled plan to mobilize €200 billion investment for AI and additional €20 billion for AI gigafactories. The declaration also targets to ensure African nations align national strategies with continental goals, safeguard data sovereignty, build digital infrastructure, and foster a sustainable AI innovation ecosystem. Additionally, participating countries endorsed the creation of the Africa AI Council which will bring together stakeholders from both the public and private sectors and will be mandated to accelerate Africa’s digital future by driving AI governance and policy development. “Africa’s digital transformation must be shaped by African priorities, talent, and leadership. The Africa AI Council is a bold and necessary platform to ensure AI serves the continent’s development goals. By scaling locally grounded solutions, we can reduce structural inequalities and accelerate progress in health, agriculture, and education,” added Dr. Paulin Basinga, Africa Director at the Gates Foundation. Latest projections indicate that AI could contribute an estimated $2.9 trillion to the African economy by 2030."
"PACJA tips EU Parliament on fair trade policies, enhanced climate funding",https://www.kbc.co.ke/pacja-urges-eu-parliament-to-promote-fair-trade-investment-with-africa/,2025-04-10T11:03:38+03:00,PACJA Executive Director Dr. Mithika Mwenda,"Policy incoherence remains a major hurdle in advancing meaningful development in climate and energy, transport, health, education and research sectors. This has resulted in an uncoordinated development agenda between the global North and South. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director Dr Mithika Mwenda says incoherent policies can lead to unintended consequences like funding green initiatives while investing in fossil fuels, tightening migration policies and promoting labor mobility policies. According to the Climate Finance Initiative report dubbed Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa 2024, Climate financing for Africa grew by 48pc to USD 44 billion in 2021/22. However, this is only a quarter of what is required to realize its 2030 goals. Experts say that climate action, economic growth and social policies should be designed to strengthen each other rather than creating new vulnerabilities and gaps. Addressing a meeting convened by the European Union Parliament, Dr. Mwenda urged the European Parliament to engage transparently with the global south to ensure commitments are met and financing is predictable and easily accessible. Mithika noted that the Global Gateway Initiative, which targets to mobilize up to €300 billion in investments through a Team Europe approach, should be structured in a manner that enhances global north-south relations. “This is in addition to the Global Gateway initiative, aiming to “enable African countries to integrate their raw materials and resources into sustainable global value chains” by 2030. While, for instance, 63pc of the world’s cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, without mentioning other global south countries providing critical Raw Minerals, it is the best opportunity to advance a just, equitable and inclusive transition.” Dr. Mithika said. The PACJA Executive Director further said Parliamentary debates, sessions, and committee hearings should include voices from Africa and the global south in general to ensure perspectives from affected countries are considered and shape the EU policies. The meeting has also said EU parliaments must push for trade and investment agreements that promote shared prosperity rather than exploitative relationships."

Israel also plans to support Kenya in minimizing technical and commercial losses by sharing its expertise in renewable power storage and grid stabilisation to improve output into the grid. Latest data by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) indicates that technical losses which occur in transmission and distribution lines rose to 24.2pc in six months of the year to December 2024, far above the 17.5pc threshold. On the other hand, Kenya is still grappling with commercial losses which arise from illegal connections unmetered connections, unread meters and meter tampering. The agreement also targets to build the country’s capacity by improving professional training schools and establishing collaboration with universities and colleges of human capital development. Isreal will also help Kenya set up a Centre of Excellence for energy where human capital will be honned for the country’s sustainability of the green energy. “It is the only surest way to through which as a country you will sustain the transition to green power” said Lotem. According to EPRA, renewable energy currently makes up 81.2pc of Kenya’s total installed capacity of 3,192MW."

The new portfolio unveiled at the inaugural CGIAR Science Week in Nairobi is designed not just to adapt to today’s pressing needs but to actively shape a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. The new phase of CGIAR action is more collaborative, focused, and ambitious, building on 50 years of science expertise and its extensive partner networks. Speaking during the launch at the United Nations Complex in Gigirin Nairobi, CGIAR Executive Managing Director, Ismahane Elouafi noted that the new portfolio unites the work of all CGIAR Centers into a single strategic platform comprising of eight science programs, one scaling program and four accelerators which reflects a renewed commitment to delivering transformative solutions . “The portfolio is more than a set of programs and accelerators. It is a unified platform designed for impact. It reflects our renewed commitment to not only improving productivity but also nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and social equity,” said Elouafi. According to Elouafi, the Research Portfolio is a direct response to global calls for action by world leaders, science experts, and farmers on the frontline of today’s agricultural crises. Anchored in frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 2025 Paris Agreement, and the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Research Portfolio reflects the reality that today’s food systems can no longer deliver nutrition, equity, or sustainability for our growing populations. The Research Portfolio aims to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and resilience they need to thrive, with smallholder farmers in the Global South being the most affected. With a global workforce of over 10,000 staff across 80+ countries and a wide network of partnerships, CGIAR is uniquely positioned to coordinate a global response powered by pioneering agricultural science. On her part, CGIAR Chief Scientist Sandra Milach highlighted that the Research Portfolio is established around Science Programs focused on critical needs, a Scaling for Impact Program to ensure innovation is widely adopted, and accelerators to boost both research and technology adoption. “50 years ago, we turned to science for solutions,” said Milach, “The CGIAR centers were created to help farmers produce food, and together with our partners, have since saved millions of lives in Africa and Asia. However, the world is different now. We are facing climate change, biodiversity loss and new conflicts. Once again, we will need to build capabilities to be able to address these new problems. Today, we must develop research that can truly address these issues.” Combined, these components aggregate expertise and partnerships around high-priority targets to collectively deliver scalable solutions that tackle the most pressing global agricultural challenges. The stakeholders know best A key strength of the Research Portfolio is its collaborative design developed alongside key
stakeholders such as national agricultural research institutions and the farmers themselves. Through global “Listening Sessions” and consultations with governments, regional bodies, national research institutions, and local farming communities, CGIAR ensures the portfolio reflects real-world needs and responds to priorities at national,
regional, and global levels. The design also builds on analysis of CGIAR’s cutting-edge innovations and technologies that factor in current discourse on global agricultural needs and challenges from shifting diets and demographics to climate volatility and geopolitical shocks. The result is a forward-looking research and innovation agenda that integrates science, policy, and
partnerships to achieve lasting impact. CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio will benefit food, land and water systems across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by accelerating agricultural productivity growth, leading to better-functioning markets, strengthened livelihoods and new job and income opportunities for workers in the agrifood system, especially women. It builds on a solid foundation of existing work while expanding into emerging areas of science with potential for impact, helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty while supporting low-income producers and consumers for the decades to come. Stakeholders know best  At the heart of the new strategy is a collaborative design process informed by global “Listening Sessions,” ensuring that innovations are locally relevant and globally scalable. The inclusion of accelerators also signals CGIAR’s intention to move research beyond experimentation into real-world application bridging the gap between science and adoption.

Speaking at the World Chambers Federation Africa Summit 2025, President Ruto said called on the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) through its devolved chapters to champion pro-business reforms, eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks in order to support local entrepreneurs in the 47 counties. “To encourage this, we are developing a County Ease of Doing Business Index to drive healthy competition, accountability, and progress,” he stated. Among processes the government is seeking to support counties in adopting, is the Unified Business Permit which has since been rolled out in Nairobi County. According to the President, chambers of commerce are critical in bringing proactive and solutions-oriented perspective which foster economic growth through public and private sector linkages. President Ruto further highlighted the role of chambers in helping businesses navigate risk, unlock
opportunities, and expand into global markets. “In Kenya, we fully embrace this transformation. In 2022, 41pc of our exports were destined for African countries. Our manufacturers and tech start-ups are expanding across the region, demonstrating our strong conviction that Kenya’s and Africa’s economic fortunes lie in intra-African trade and cooperation,” he added. Kenya backs its investments in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and border posts to markets, fibre-optic networks, and renewable energy to continue supporting enterprise in order to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost exports and enhance economic growth."

Kapkoros Tea Factory has been involved in a wrangle with two of its subsidiaries, Motigo and Olenguruone whose farmers had boycotted plucking and delivering their green leaf  to the factory demanding for financial and operational independence. Following a meeting convened on Tuesday by Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, Motigo and Olenguruone tea factories will now operate as independent entities. “That the directors agree on the modalities of separation, to take due cognizance of all the issues obtaining, and exercise fairness in the discharge of their responsibilities,” said Kagwe. On December 15, 2023, farmers from Motigo and Olenguruone had voted for separation of their accounts and financial autonomy from Kapkoros which was subsequently approved in the Annual General Meeting held on December 12, last year. The resolution also received overwhelming support from Kapkoros Tea Factory Board during the meeting held on January 9, this year. During today’s meeting, Kagwe also directed farmers from Motigo and Olenguruone to immediately resume
plucking and delivery of green leaf to their respective factories. “That henceforth, all parties cease hostilities against each other and stop engaging in any action that may interfere with normal operations or management of the 4 tea factories, and withdraw all active petitions, and court cases,” added Kagwe. Coding and issuance of the smart cards to farmers in the two factories is also set to proceed as earlier planned. Under the deal, Kamogoso Tea factory which also manages Tirgaga Tea Factory shall support construction of Kamogoso Tea Factory and modernize old factories with government assistance. Additionally, directors, in conjunction with their management agent, Kenya Tea Development Agency are expected to take urgent measures to address the high cost of production in all the four factories based in Bomet County, and also enhance the quality of teas. Kagwe further warns that factories found to be perpetuating the hawking of green leaf tea to be delicensed in accordance with the Tea Act, 2020."
Kenya’s retail market evolves as Adidas originals opens at Westgate Mall,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-retail-market-evolves-as-adidas-originals-opens-at-westgate-mall/,2025-04-07T17:31:50+03:00,"Adidas,Westgate Mall","Kenya continues to position itself as a key destination for international brands, with the latest entrant being Adidas Originals. The globally recognized sports and lifestyle brand has officially expanded its presence in Kenya with a new store at Westgate Mall in Westlands, introduced by WAMA International Group. This move reflects a broader trend of global brands entering or expanding in Kenya. Companies such as Nike, Puma, and Levi’s already have a presence in the country, capitalizing on Kenya’s growing middle class and increasing consumer demand for high-quality lifestyle and fashion products. Westgate Mall, which hosts over 80 stores, has become a prime location for such brands looking to establish a foothold in the region. The rise of Westgate Mall as a premier retail hub is particularly significant given its history. The mall was the site of a tragic terror attack in 2013, an event that tested Nairobi’s resilience. However, the mall has since been rebuilt and re-imagined, emerging as a symbol of strength and economic revival. Today, it stands as one of Nairobi’s leading shopping destinations, attracting both global brands and local entrepreneurs eager to tap into Kenya’s dynamic retail market. Kenya’s fashion industry has experienced significant growth, influenced by both international and local trends. While global brands continue to expand their presence, the local market is highly competitive, with both original and non-original brands vying for consumer attention. Counterfeit products, often sold at lower prices, present a challenge for premium brands like Adidas, which emphasize quality, authenticity, and innovation. At the same time, Kenya’s local manufacturing sector is working to carve out a space in the fashion industry. Designers and entrepreneurs are pushing for “Made in Kenya” products, with a focus on sustainable fashion, locally sourced materials, and unique African-inspired designs. However, they face stiff competition from established global brands, both in terms of brand recognition and consumer preference. WAMA International, a retail company with over 30 stores across different regions, says it has ambitious expansion plans in East Africa. The opening of Adidas Originals in Nairobi underscores the confidence international investors have in Kenya’s retail market, driven by a strong consumer base and a steadily growing economy. The new Adidas Originals store aims to enhance the shopping experience with a curated selection of lifestyle footwear, apparel, and accessories for both men and women. The store’s strategic location within Westgate Mall allows it to tap into the mall’s high foot traffic and diverse customer base. The grand opening on April 4 was marked by a lively launch event featuring live entertainment, DJ performances, sneaker customization, and a celebration of local culture. The event reflected Adidas’ commitment to creativity, inclusion, and sustainability while aligning with Nairobi’s vibrant urban scene. As global brands tailor their offerings to local preferences, Adidas Originals’ entry into the Kenyan market follows a similar approach. Companies like Carrefour and LC Waikiki have successfully adapted their business models to resonate with Kenyan consumers, reinforcing the country’s growing reputation as a lucrative retail destination. “It has been a great experience to partner with WAMA International Group and bring the first adidas Originals standalone store to Nairobi. As a brand, we are committed to expanding our presence in Africa and making a positive impact in the communities we serve,” said Brett Burgess, Senior Director, Africa Export, EM South. Ismael Elmahdy, Head of Retail at WAMA International Group, shared his enthusiasm, stating, “We are thrilled to launch our first Adidas Originals store in East Africa. This marks a significant milestone in our expansion strategy, and we look forward to offering Kenyan consumers world-class products and experiences.” The Adidas Originals store is now open on the first floor of Westgate Mall, Nairobi, joining a growing list of international brands that view Kenya as a strategic market in Africa. Meanwhile, the country’s local fashion industry continues to evolve, balancing tradition, innovation, and competition with global players."
Seafarers to get key document to expand job opportunities ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/seafarers-to-get-key-document-to-expand-job-opportunities/,2025-04-07T15:28:19+03:00,,"The government is in the process of making Seafarers Identification Documents which will enable seafarers to work in foreign countries, according to Labour Cabinet Secretary Dr. Alfred Mutua. Speaking at an induction workshop for the Seafarers’ and Wages Council in Kilifi County, Dr Mutua said lack of the document make it for local seafarers to seek carriers in other territories despite numerous available opportunities. “Just like to any other professional another critical issue to Seafarers is the Seafarers Identity Document (SID). Without this document, securing opportunities to work outside the country in the maritime sector is extremely difficult. I will ensure that those without it receive the necessary support to obtain it to unlock access to job opportunities abroad,” said Dr Mutua. He said the maritime sector offers a wide range of employment opportunities in areas such as fishing, sea freight and cruise ships which they youth could explore. This comes as the government commits to address unique challenges faced by seafarers with the establishment of the Seafarers’ Wages Council. “For far too long, the men and women who power the maritime sector, our seafarers have faced numerous challenges including precarious employment conditions, low wages and inadequate social protection,” Mutua said. However, Mutua said one of the major challenges in seafarer training is the lack of dedicated training vessels and therefore urged ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to ensure they are fully equipped with the necessary skills upon completing their courses. “The training which is currently conducted is not real training unless there’s practicals. I therefore ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to prepare them for employment,” he said. The wages council is mandated with providing economic policy interventions as well as job creation by ensuring the existence of a well-regulated and attractive working environment which will encourage more Kenyans to pursue careers in the maritime industry. The council will also ensure fair wages and decent working conditions to seafarers as per the Employment Act, enhance Kenya’s competitiveness as a maritime nation by attracting the training skill maritime profession, strengthen the protection of seafarer’s rights by promoting their welfare and dignity and also enforce a social dialogue among employers, employees and relevant government institutions to maintain industrial harmony in the maritime sector. The CS urged the council to adopt best practices from successful maritime nations and continuously engage in capacity-building initiatives. “To discharge your mandate, you should strive to carry out comparative learning in other successful countries and engage in continuous capacity building which is the pillar of providing a forum for members to discuss, consult and make crucial decisions while equipping them with adequate governance skills, he noted."
Manufacturers urged to leverage US tariff move to boost exports,https://www.kbc.co.ke/manufacturers-urged-to-leverage-us-tariff-move-to-boost-exports/,2025-04-07T14:34:11+03:00,"Tariff,trade","Agro-processors should take advantage of the reciprocal tariffs on a number of countries by the US and increase exports to America. Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) says the tariff increase to 10pc imposed on Kenyan products is significantly lower than the rates Kenya’s major competitors in the US textile market face. Kenya is among 185 countries that were slapped with tariff increases ranging from 10 to 50pc by the US government. Trade between Kenya and the U.S. is estimated to reach Ksh 177 billion with Kenya exporting Ksh 64.3 billion worth of goods while buying products worth Ksh 112.8 billion. Textiles, apparel, and coffee, account for over 40pc of Kenya’s exports to the U.S. market. KNCCI says the move by the US government to increase tariffs on a number of nations will open up the market more Kenyan textile and apparel products. According to the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the 10pc tariff on Kenyan products is significantly lower than the rates facing Vietnam ( at 46pc), Sri Lanka (at 44pc), Bangladesh (at 37pc), China (at 34pc), Pakistan (at 29pc), and India (at 26pc), which are Kenya’s major competitors in textile manufacturing. Textile and apparel manufacturers have been encouraged to invest in facility upgrades, value-addition processes, and workforce development to meet anticipated increased demand. To mitigate against the new tariffs, manufacturers have been advised to increase value addition on coffee, tea, and horticultural goods destined for the US market. However the chamber admits that the 10pc tariff will increase costs for exporters in the short term denying them much needed capital for expansion. KNCCI further warns that any additional long-term protectionism policies by the US will reduce Kenya exporters market access, urging exporters to expand their international market."

Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir says the bond which will be floated within the next 90 days will target both domestic and eternal bond markets. In the meantime, Chirchir says the government has secured Ksh 74 billion bridge facility from Trade Development Bank and Afreximbank through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to begin immediate payment to contractors under a structured settlement agreement in order to facilitate commencement of stalled road projects across the country. “We are paying them today 40pc of what we owe them through the bridge facility and we expect them to go back to work on all the roads where there are those contracts. We that would shortly be seeing all the road contractors back to work. The first bridge facility of about Ksh 74 billion is basically done. We have received Ksh 63b today and through a structured settlement agreement which is a return to work formula,” said Chirchir. According to Chirchir, the loan which has attracted an interest of 7.8pc for a period of two years is expected to be cleared with proceeds from the infrastructure bond which will be floated on both the domestic and the international market. 80pc of the funds will be raised on the external bond market with the balance from the domestic market. For both the bridge facility and the bond, Chirchir says the government will use the Ksh 7 shillings added on the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF) in July last year as security. “What we have done with the approval of Parliament giving us the additional Ksh 7 of the roads maintenance levy on top of the current Ksh 18 sometimes in July last year was to take a bold decision to securitize the Ksh 7 to raise about Ksh 175 billion through a bond issuance but we have structured it with the bridge facility that brings in a loan facility quickly to be able to pay the contractors, get them back to work and get work on all these roads starting again,” added Chirchir. Chirchir says out of the Ksh 55 billion which was appropriated to clear pending bills by the excheuers, only Ksh 35 billion has been paid. According to projections by the Kenya Roads Board (KRB), the annual RMLF revenue will increase to Ksh 115 billion from the Ksh 25 being charged on petrol and diesel."

According to the latest report by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), the revitalized port handled 280,381 metric tons (MT) of cargo in 2024—more than double the 116,578 MT recorded the previous year. The momentum has carried into 2025, with the port already processing 109,839 MT in the first quarter alone, signaling sustained growth and strong regional demand. The port has also seen a notable increase in ship traffic, with 67 vessels docking so far this year. Seven major ships which include Orion III, Uhuru II, MT Elgon, MT Kabaka Mutebi III, MV Munanka, Mango Tree, and MV Noris now operate regular routes through Kisumu. Fuel exports continue to dominate outbound trade, accounting for 58pc of shipments, followed by ceramic tiles (23pc), construction materials and steel billets (13pc), and bagged fertilizers (6pc). These commodities are shipped to strategic regional destinations such as Jinja and Port Bell in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. Highlighting the port’s expanded export operations, MV Orion II made a call over the weekend to load 600 MT of ceramic tiles for export to Port Bell. The vessel, which has become known for handling ceramics, now stops at the port every two weeks, reflecting the consistency and reliability of Kisumu’s shipping schedule. KPA Managing Director Captain William Ruto said the surge in throughput was a clear testament to the port’s rising role as a regional logistics hub. Ruto attributed the rapid growth to continued investment in infrastructure and operations at the facility which has improved turnaround time for clearance of goods. “We are seeing more cargo, more ships, and greater efficiency thanks to continued investment in infrastructure and operations,” he said. Ruto credited the port’s growth to modernization efforts, including the upgrade of berths, improved cargo handling facilities, and enhanced connectivity through the Kisumu-Nairobi meter-gauge railway (MGR) line. He also cited ongoing projects such as the construction of new storage facilities, a modern passenger terminal, and the introduction of advanced cargo handling equipment. “The future of Kisumu Port lies in smart technologies, efficient logistics, and deeper regional integration. We are building a facility that meets both current and future demands of trade across Lake Victoria,” he said. Kisumu Port Manager in charge of Cargo Services Operations Patrick Makau said the port anticipates more improvements in safety and efficiency while focusing on modernization, better regional transport integration, and embracing smart port technologies. The Port of Kisumu is one of the ports on Lake Victoria that offer organized shipping services on Lake Victoria. The other ports are: Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda; and Mwanza, Bukoba, and Musoma in Tanzania. Out of these ports, Kisumu, Mwanza and Port Bell are the largest, in terms of throughput."

Speaking during the roll out of the programme, Agriculture Principal Secretary Dr Paul Rono lauded Uasin Gishu’s efforts, stating that the programs align perfectly with the national government’s agenda for economic transformation and food security. “With this vaccination program, coffee expansion, and the embrace of JUNCAO grass, our farmers are poised for real empowerment, and we envision a dollar economy rooted in agriculture, and Uasin Gishu is leading the way. This county is well on its path to becoming a coffee production hub, and we are welcoming investors to support that vision,” said the PS. Rono also emphasized the importance of regulation in the agricultural sector, noting the government’s ongoing verification of pesticides and commitment to eliminating unauthorized products from the market further urging farmers to embrace artificial insemination (AI) services, which have now been made more affordable, and to focus on upgrading livestock breeds for better milk yields. “We don’t want Uasin Gishu to just be a breadbasket, but we want it to be a wealthy basket, and our goal is to put farmers at the forefront, with access to better markets, packaging, and production technologies,” he added. The Principal Secretary also directed that all extension officers issued with motorcycles must hold valid driving licenses and encouraged a disciplined, farmer-first approach in their operations. The initiative, which begins in Sergoit Ward, allows farmers to access Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines at a highly subsidized cost of Ksh 17 per animal, down from the previous Ksh 150. Backed by Ksh 2.7 million in funding and implemented through the Tuiyotich Cooperative, the program is targeting 20,000 animals. It also introduces digital animal IDs and leverages automated payments through Safaricom to ensure transparency and accountability. “This is a historic step for our county and a model for the rest of the country, we are empowering our farmers with affordable, tech-driven solutions that will protect their livestock and improve productivity,” said Dr Jonathan Bii, Uasin Gishu County Governor. As part of broader efforts to enhance agricultural extension services, the county unveiled 21 new motorcycles distributed to ward-level agricultural officers to enhance service delivery, ensuring that farmers receive timely support and technical guidance and also launched the distribution of 133,000 coffee seedlings to the farmers, a move embraced by ready awaiting prepared farmers. The Governor also disbursed cheques worth Ksh 2.42 million to Sugutek Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS) and Ksh 2.64 million to Tuiyotich FCS to support the cooperatives. The funds are designated for solarization projects under the Enterprise Development Grant Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in farming operations. Additionally, the county and national government teams’ rollout JUNCAO grass, a high-yield, protein-rich fodder crop capable of six harvests annually, supporting up to 18 animals per acre. The county will also establish 28 demonstration plots across various wards to promote the adoption of this fodder, to significantly boost dairy production. Deputy Governor Evans Kapkea echoed these sentiments, praising the integration of Governor Bii’s Nguzo Kumi development framework with the BETA agenda. “It’s now up to us farmers to seize the opportunities offered and uplift ourselves economically,” he said. Augustine Choge, head of the BETA Implementation Team, confirmed that the e-voucher system is already in effect, with all cattle registered in the system."

According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."

According to the data by the Tea Board of Kenya, more than 60pc of Kenya’s tea is sold through auction monthly. Speaking in Nyeri County during the International Tea Celebrations in Nyeri County, Kagwe said the move to allow direct tea sales on the international market is part of reforms by the government to promote and diversify Kenyan tea. “Am also happy to report that, shortly through reforms being spearheaded by my Ministry; we will soon be allowing tea factories to sell their teas directly into the international markets without intermediaries. This strategy will augment Government of Kenya Marketing efforts, therefore translate to increased earnings to our tea farmers,” said Kagwe. According to TBK, in January alone, Kenya sold 33.4 million kilograms of tea through auction out of total production which stood at 54.4 million kilograms. The government also plans to unveil an orthodox tea auction window within the Integrated Tea Trading System (ITTS) in June this year in collaboration with the the East African Tea Association (EATTA) and TBK. This is expected to allow for sale of orthodox teas globally. “The orthodox tea auction will set the stage for a reliable distribution outlet that is expected to enhance renewed impetus to sustainable product diversification from Cut, Tear and Curl i.e. (CTC teas) to orthodox teas,” Kagwe stated. As part of its diversification strategy, the country is also eying new international markets in the Far East, Middle East, China, Russia and India. Kenya saw an increase in tea export destination in January this year as markets grew to 61 compared to 58 during the same period last year."
Poor farming practices blamed for low maize production,https://www.kbc.co.ke/poor-farming-practices-blamed-for-low-maize-production/,2025-05-02T11:44:33+03:00,"Agriculture,Maize","The low production of maize in the country has been attributed to diseases, poor pest control methods, wrong use of fertilizer and failure to innovate. Currently, Kenya farmers productivity per acre in maize production stands at 2 metric tonnes as compared to Tanzania 3 metric and Zambia 3.5 metric tonnes. As a result the country has for decades resulted in the import of millions of tonnes of maize to address the shortages and feed its increasing population. To address this, farmers have been urged to procure genuine, government approved and environmentally friendly chemicals that promise higher yields from their farms. According to M.L Sharma, the General Managing Director, Rainbow Company in East Africa, the main challenges currently facing farmers was poor use of chemicals that led to low production. Sharma said the company had introduced various cost effective and innovative products that promised to reverse decades of poor yields by controlling destructive pests and diseases. He said Kenya, where maize production occupied more than 40pc of farms cultivation had grappled with the destructive fall army worms that had left farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Director said the company has introduced in the Kenyan market a cost effective chemical to control the army worms which would in turn increase farms yields by 10 percent. “Our range of chemical products introduced in the Kenyan market will enhance productivity for farmers by 10 percent while they are cost effective by 7pc,” said Sharma. Sharma made remarks during a farmers-field in Naivasha, an event that attracted over 5,000 farmers from different counties. On his part, the company CEO Wicky Wang said the chemicals introduced met the country and global quality measures and were environmentally friendly amidst calls to control the level of toxicity in farms locally. Wang said through cutting edge technology and innovation, the range of chemical products would help farmers increase their yields and returns. According to Agatha Musau, a distributor, the products such as Europlus, readout and turncap had shown improved efficacy in potatoes, vegetable and maize farming. Musau said the chemicals were cost friendly and had shown better results in farms as compared with other products. On his part, David Njau, a coffee farmer said the introduction of five star chemicals offered reliefs to the control of fungal infection in coffee trees mainly during cold seasons. He welcomed the products which are cheaper and readily available to farmers noting that they would offer relief by containing destructive pests and diseases."

According to the nationally determined contributions blueprint released on Wednesday, the new plan will take effect from January 2031 to December 2035. The 2nd NDC blueprint was submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change on 30th of April 2025, hours before the UN imposed deadline to submit the blueprint expired. According to a statement from the ministry of environment, Kenya will internally contribute 270 billion shillings annually from 2031 to 2035 for mitigation and adaptation measures to lower emissions by 75.25 Million tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). The country will focus on international support, including finance, investments, technology development and transfer, capacity building, as well as participation in carbon markets to achieve the remaining 80% funding. The statement say the NDC will be revised to align with the country’s forthcoming Long-Term Development Vision which is under development to replace the Vision 2030, which lapses in five years-time. The first nationally determined contributions was revised in 2020, five years after the original draft was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The document had set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Kenya had outlined a 62 billion dollar budget target to achieve the ambitious plan. However the plan has faced many challenges including lack of financing and budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic meltdown caused by supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. Under the current NDC Kenya aims to invest more in renewable energy, sustainable land use, ecosystems and nature-based solutions, smart agriculture, green infrastructure and urban development among others interventions. Under the updated NDC Kenya seeks to deploy innovation and technology in keys sectors such as health, agriculture, infrastructural development and education. The document also talks about public-private partnerships to drive green investments. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 12 of the Paris Agreement, there are 214 Countries that have submitted their 10 year plans to the NDC registry. The plans are supposed to be update after every five years. In 2023, Kenya launched a five year National Climate Change Action Plan III that elapses in 2027. The document is a planning tool to help in the implementation of the NDC measures aligned with vision 2030 and the Climate Change Act, 2023. The ministry of environment says the updated plan-2031-2035 is expected to drive transformative economic development, innovation, and inclusive growth across key sectors of the Kenyan economy."

Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The event has brought together CEOs, directors, and senior leaders from national standards bodies around the world to focus on developing strategic leadership skills suited to the challenges of modern economies. Representing the Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), Dr. Henry Rotich, Director of Metrology & Testing, officially opened the session, emphasizing that impactful leadership today calls for more than technical excellence. “It requires strategic vision, emotional intelligence, and adaptive thinking the very skills that reinforce trust in trade, safety in products, and fairness in services,” he noted. Dr. Rotich underlined that the decisions leaders make in their boardrooms ripple across industries, economies, and communities, making leadership development critical to sustaining the future of standards and innovation. “By strengthening ourselves intellectually, we empower our institutions, and stronger institutions underpin the smart systems that millions rely on for quality, safety, and confidence,” Dr. Rotich added. He thanked ISO for its longstanding leadership in capacity-building across regions, including the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, and most recently Asia, and celebrated Kenya’s pride in hosting this important milestone. Erick Kieck, Director of Capacity Building at ISO, emphasized ISO’s deep commitment to leadership development, particularly among members from developing countries. “It is essential for us to invest in growing the leadership competencies of our members. They are the ones helping us navigate the complexities and challenges facing global standardization today,” Kieck remarked. He noted that three-quarters of ISO’s 175 members come from the developing world, underscoring the need for inclusive approaches to resilience and innovation. Zakaria Lukorito, Director of Standards Development and Trade at KEBS, highlighted the importance of Kenya actively participating in shaping the future of standardization. “This program gives us a valuable opportunity to both learn and contribute. We are taking full advantage to strengthen leadership within our institutions and to share our experiences at regional and international levels,” he said. Over the coming days, delegates will explore strategic governance, institutional resilience, innovation leadership, and emerging technology trends, including the fast-evolving impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global trade and standards development. Further, Dr. Rotich urged participants to approach the workshop with curiosity and courage: “Let us listen with openness, share boldly, and leave wiser, re-energized, and ready to lead with renewed purpose,” he said."
Creatives urged to commercialize ideas for economic gain,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urged-to-commercialize-ideas-for-economic-gain/,2025-04-28T17:34:17+03:00,"Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA),Innovators","Young innovators and artists have been urged to move beyond merely creating and protecting their work to fully commercializing their ideas as a way of securing economic empowerment, national pride, and global recognition. Speaking during the celebration of World Intellectual Property Day 2025 KICC, Dr. Juma Mukhwana, the Principal Secretary for the State Department of Industry, emphasized that while protection of intellectual property was important, commercialization was the ultimate mark of success. He challenged creatives to focus on producing marketable innovations, insisting that success is measured not by the number of exhibitions attended but by the number of products, songs, or ideas sold. “If you are not selling your innovation, it is a useless innovation. If you are not selling your music, it is of no use, it isn’t music. So, discovering an idea and walking around from one exhibition to another without selling is a waste of time,” said the PS adding that creatives may spend a lot of time producing things that don’t see the light of day and that the measure of success of any design, idea, product or song is their commercial value. Mukhwana highlighted a troubling gap in Kenya’s innovation sector, noting that despite the high number of registered patents and trademarks, only less than 10 percent are commercialized. He warned that innovation without market presence risks becoming obsolete within a few years. Encouraging the youth, he pointed out that Africa’s large and growing market presents an open opportunity for Kenyan creatives to reach beyond local the local market. He urged innovators to avoid hiding their talents, collaborate where necessary for marketing and sales, and to cultivate a culture of loving Kenyan innovations and products as a means of driving economic growth. “Don’t think about the Kenyan market of 55 million customers; the government has opened a wider market in the African Continental Free Trade Area with about 1.4 billion people. If you make a product in Kenya, you can sell it to all the countries across East Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, DRC, South Sudan, Somalia. You can sell it in the rest of Africa,” he stated. The call to action was echoed by John Onyango, the Managing Director of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI), who stressed on the immense economic potential within the creative sector, especially music. Onyango acknowledged the celebration as a milestone for musicians and the broader creative industry, recognizing not only singers but also composers, producers, and recorders stood to benefit from patenting and trademarking their creations. He emphasized that intellectual property is a powerful tool for unlocking economic opportunities and driving national development. Onyango observed a positive shift in Kenyan audiences increasingly embracing local music, a departure from previous decades when foreign music dominated local airwaves. He described music as a vital channel for communication, influencing behavior and societal attitudes. Beyond its cultural value, he stressed that music has a formidable economic value chain right from composers and songwriters to publishers, performers, and manufacturers that could substantially contribute to job creation, income generation, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He urged musicians to treat their craft as a serious business rather than a pastime, noting that organizations such as the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) and the Anti-Counterfeit Authority are working to protect their rights and ensure they earn rightful royalties. “Look at music as a business, not just a pastime undertaking. This is a real business that can generate a lot of income,” said Onyango. Onyango reaffirmed KIPI’s commitment to empowering young creatives, and called on the government to enhance its support for the sector to realize its full potential in boosting the country’s economy. Similarly, Dr. Robi Mbugua, the Chief Executive Officer of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, emphasized that creativity is deliberate labor, not mere chance. He further warned that piracy and counterfeiting of creative works are not only illegal but also violations against national dignity. He disclosed that over the past five years, enforcement efforts had resulted in the seizure of counterfeit music equipment valued at over Ksh 30 million. Dr. Mbugua hailed the proposed merger of KIPI, ACA and KECOBO into the Kenya Industrial Property Authority which will handle registration, custody, and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Kenya, noting that it would enhance the fight against counterfeiting. He assured creatives that the government is taking steps to ensure their work is recognized, respected, and rewarded. He said that creativity, must be protected not only by law but by society’s collective will, as music and other forms of art play critical roles in teaching, healing, inspiring, and unifying people. Allan Kosgei, the KIPI Board Chairman highlighted ongoing efforts to digitize processes within the organization with support from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), noting that it’d enhance transparency and efficiency in service delivery. He emphasized that supporting innovators and creatives is integral to achieving Kenya’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. Josphat Kabeabea, Chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, further rallied behind the creatives, noting that Kenya’s history is told through music, dance, poetry, and storytelling, which serve not only as cultural artifacts but also as political tools and economic assets. He challenged lawmakers to critically assess whether the current copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms adequately protect creators, urging stronger legislation and real budgetary support for the creative economy. Kabeabea further warned that neglecting creators would leave the nation without its stories, culture, or soul and urged Kenyans, as their civic duty, to protect their intellectual property. The government, through its various agencies, pledged its continued support in ensuring that Kenya’s creative and innovation sectors thrive not just for national pride, but for real economic transformation."
Unlocking Africa’s Leather Potential,https://www.kbc.co.ke/unlocking-africas-leather-potential/,2025-04-27T17:01:53+03:00,"Africa,Leather","As global demand for authentic, sustainable, and culturally inspired fashion rises, Africa stands uniquely positioned with its rich heritage, abundant resources, and a vibrant creative youth population. Yet, despite its natural advantages, the continent’s leather industry remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and largely absent from global value chains. A major reason: the lack of a cohesive ecosystem that aligns skills development, market access, design innovation, and strategic branding. The Africa Leather and Leather Products Institute (ALLPI), the continent’s lead agency for leather sector development, is spearheading efforts to close these gaps. Through investments in training, infrastructure, creative industry linkages, and global partnerships, ALLPI is working to position African leather not just as a raw commodity, but as a source of high-value finished products that can compete on the world stage. At the 2025 Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week (ASFW) held in Nairobi, Mr. Nicholus Mudungwe, Executive Director of ALLPI, delivered a rallying call that captured the urgency of this mission. His message was clear: Africa’s leather future must be market-driven, globally connected, creatively powered — and above all, strategically designed to win. Mudungwe cautioned against traditional siloed approaches to skills development. “Curriculum should not be designed in isolation,” he said. “It must be informed by the end — by what the market actually demands.” He stressed that training institutions must collaborate closely with manufacturers, fashion houses, and distributors, because distributors have their finger on the pulse of consumer preferences, including emerging trends in colour, texture, and style. “The distributors know what the market is asking for,” he explained. “That intelligence must shape production, and this, in turn, must shape what and how we train.” Without such feedback loops, he warned, African training systems risk producing graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the modern industry. To address this gap, ALLPI is rolling out regional design studios across member states and building partnerships with global fashion leaders such as Academia de la Moda. These collaborations are aimed at helping African technical institutions develop industrial, market-driven courses, drawing from international best practices to stay competitive. Mudungwe also acknowledged Africa’s abundant design talent scattered across the continent but lamented the lack of economies of scale and limited market access. “You can have an excellent product,” he observed, “but if it’s not connected to a market, it remains invisible.” In response, ALLPI is expanding the leather sector’s engagement with the broader creative ecosystem, involving sports personalities, musicians, and actors to champion African leather products. “If a football star wears shoes made in Africa or an actor carries an African leather bag,” Mudungwe said, “it sends a strong signal not only to the continent but to the world.” He emphasised that market capture must precede scaling production. Building consumer mindshare, he noted, would naturally drive volume growth and secure Africa’s place in the global fashion economy. Beyond flagship initiatives like the Real Leather. Stay Different. (RLSD) competition — which identifies and nurtures emerging African design talent — Mudungwe outlined broader ALLPI strategies aimed at transforming the sector. “We are already seeing signs of success,” he reported. “Enterprises and artisans we have worked with have significantly improved their product quality. Some are now supplying established retail chains, others are supplying government departments, and several have entered export markets.” He described RLSD as a catalyst that has helped shift mindsets and raise standards across the sector. Yet ALLPI is going even further by setting up a dedicated programme for product design and development across its member countries. Importantly, Mudungwe stressed the need to create a secondary market for design itself — allowing brilliant young designers to sell their creative concepts to producers, even if they are not interested in manufacturing. “We must not limit creativity to production,” he said. “The future lies in enabling computer-aided design, digital innovation, and multiple career pathways for Africa’s youth.” Mudungwe’s presentation at ASFW Nairobi made one thing unmistakably clear: Africa’s leather revolution will not be achieved through fragmented efforts or outdated models. It will require market intelligence, global linkages, strategic branding, youth empowerment, and a bold collective vision to transform African leather into a force recognised and respected across the world."

The deal, secured during President Ruto’s recent four-day state visit to China, marks a significant step toward unlocking economic opportunities for millions of Kenyans, particularly in Western Kenya. The new SGR Phase 2B line will eventually connect Kisumu to Malaba, linking Kenya’s rail network to Uganda and strengthening regional trade routes across East Africa. Speaking on behalf of the people of Kisumu, leaders and residents have expressed deep gratitude to President Ruto for reviving the stalled railway project. “This branch of Kenya Railways has been on the drawing board for a long time. Making it a reality at last is something we in the Lake Region need to applaud. Kudos, Mr. President,” Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. The extension is expected to inject fresh vitality into Kisumu’s economy, enhance the operations of the recently refurbished Kisumu Port, and boost trade, tourism, and passenger transport across the region. Once completed, the project will not only spur economic growth but also advance Kenya’s vision for regional integration, a key pillar of BETA’s mission to build an inclusive, prosperous economy from the grassroots up. The extension of the SGR will open up new markets, cut transportation costs, and create jobs across the logistics, tourism, and agricultural value chains, all critical sectors targeted under BETA to lift millions out of poverty. By delivering on this transformative project, President Ruto has reinforced his administration’s commitment to infrastructure development as a catalyst for equitable economic growth and regional prosperity."

Leading a high-level government delegation, President Ruto participated in productive discussions with his Chinese counterpart, marking a new era in the Kenya-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. According to Statehouse, the talks resulted in significant diplomatic and economic breakthroughs, enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, infrastructure, and sustainable development. “Discussions between the two leaders focused on key priorities such as trade expansion, investment promotion, and development cooperation. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Kenya’s national development agenda,” stated Statehouse spokesperson Hussein Mohamed. In a major step towards deepening bilateral ties, Kenya and China upgraded their relationship to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era’, marked by the signing of 20 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and other frameworks of cooperation. These agreements cover various sectors including infrastructure, trade, education, digital economy, science and technology, as well as people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. During the extensive engagement, Mohamed noted that China agreed to collaborate with Kenya on implementing strategic connectivity development projects. The agreements include investments for the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway to Naivasha (Phase II) and from Naivasha to Malaba (Phase III). Additionally, they encompass the expansion and dualing of the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau Summit–Malaba highway, the Kiambu-Northern Bypass, the Eldoret Bypass, and the construction of the Nithi Bridge. “This cooperation cements Kenya’s role as a key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and regional logistics partner, while integrating East Africa’s transportation network and enhancing intra-regional trade,” he said. Furthermore, the Statehouse spokesperson confirmed that China has opened avenues for increased private sector investment, which will be directed towards the listed infrastructure projects through Public-Private Partnerships, thus accelerating development and deepening economic ties. Thursday’s meeting also saw the signing of financing instruments for the implementation of the TVET III Project, crucial for equipping TVET institutions and enhancing technical skills among Kenya’s youth. Additionally, it included the Intelligent Transport System and Junction Improvement Project for Nairobi, designed to revolutionize traffic management by minimizing human interfaces and streamlining the payment of traffic penalties. “Kenya and China also committed to further collaboration in the rollout of Kenya’s National Digital Superhighway Programme, which involves the expansion of the national fibre optic network.

Kenya seeking China’s assistance for major development projects – Mudavadi,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-seeking-chinas-assistance-for-major-development-projects-mudavadi/,2025-04-23T00:29:28+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs Musalia Mudavadi has confirmed that Kenya is eager to embark on several development projects and is seeking China’s support to bring them to life. Mudavadi, who is in China accompanying President William Ruto on his State Visit, outlined various programmes that Nairobi aims to implement in collaboration with Beijing. He underscored the necessity of modernizing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to enhance its status as a leading hub in Eastern Africa and across the continent. He said the Kenyan government is accelerating efforts to engage a new contractor for the project, following the cancellation of the previous agreement with Adani Holdings. In a meeting in China’s capital with Raymond Luo, President of Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – one of the largest international construction groups with expertise in airport development – Mudavadi revealed that they discussed the expansion of JKIA. “They shared insights from their 42 years of experience building over 30 airport terminals, runways, and specialized aviation facilities worldwide,” he stated. “I encouraged them to submit their expression of interest as Kenya prepares to invite contractors for the upcoming JKIA expansion,” he added. According to Mudavadi, Kenya continues to be a vital gateway to Africa. To reinforce this position, he highlighted the importance of maintaining momentum in strategic projects such as extending the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, upgrading the Nairobi–Malaba highway, and improving the efficiency of Mombasa Port. He reiterated that these projects are crucial for securing and strengthening Kenya’s leadership role in the region and beyond. “Advancing Africa’s connectivity is no longer optional, it’s urgent. In today’s climate of global tariff wars, we must unlock the full potential of intra-African trade,” he stated during bilateral talks with Zhonging Wang, Chief Executive Officer of the Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance. “We agreed on the critical need to break down barriers that limit trade within our 1.4 billion-strong continent, where intra-trade stands at just 16%,” the Prime CS added. In addition to airports, roads, ports, and railways, Mudavadi confirmed that Kenya is seeking China’s assistance to improve its water and sanitation sector. Following a meeting with a delegation from CGCOC Group Ltd, led by Vice President Lei Gao, Mudavadi noted that they discussed investment opportunities in Kenya’s water sector. He stressed that as country’s cities expand, the demand for robust water and sanitation systems also increases, which is essential for enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. “I emphasized that Kenya is looking for partners with the capacity and commitment to drive transformational, life-changing projects,” he said. At the same time, the Prime CS indicated that Kenya is scouting for technologies to be deployed in the fight against crime and corruption, utilizing the power of ICT and Artificial Intelligence. He made these remarks after holding talks with executives from Xinxing JiHua International Trading, a leader in manufacturing military and police equipment, as well as textiles. During the meeting, Mudavadi stated they discussed ways to strengthen Kenya’s defence and security systems. “Their innovative technologies, including overt and covert equipment, offer new tools for our security forces to enhance service delivery, transparency, and accountability,” he said. Mudavadi later met with Huawei’s Global Vice President, Mr. Wang Ke, to discuss deepening support for key government initiatives, ranging from accelerating the digital economy to expanding opportunities for the youth. “Following Huawei’s successful connection of TVETs, schools, and hospitals, we are now exploring new areas of collaboration, including rural connectivity, advanced training programmes for young Kenyans, and supporting the rollout of Kenya’s newly launched AI Strategy,” he said. The government is eager to finalize a majority of the deals targeted during President William Ruto’s current state visit to China, aiming to bring many of the above projects to fruition."

The PS who was delivered the speech on behalf of the Information, Communications and the Digital Economy, Cabinet Secretary William Kabogo, noted that Kenya has developed the National Addressing System and the supporting policy and legal instruments, to re-orient the post for last-mile delivery and e-commerce. “As I speak, the draft National Addressing System standards, Policy and Bill are awaiting consideration in Parliament.  Once enacted, these instruments will usher a golden era for the post in Kenya, particularly in e-commerce and last mile delivery.” The PS noted. Similarly, the government is implementing the Kenya National e-commerce Strategy to bolster its position as a digital frontrunner in Africa. “The strategy will go a long way in facilitating an inclusive and widespread utilization of trusted and secure e-commerce services in the country. The strategy’s focus areas are enhancement of digital trade infrastructure, promoting trust and consumer protection in online trade, and supporting Micro, small, and medium enterprises.” He added. Further, to ensure that sector laws facilitate the continued growth of the post, the PS remarked that the ICT Ministry is spearheading the review of postal and ICT sector laws to align with technological and market trends. To this end he says, the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been submitted to Parliament for consideration. “Legal reform will facilitate the ICT sector regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to bring new and emerging services in the postal and e-commerce sub-market under its regulatory ambit.” He noted. The PS stressed on the significant socio-economic role the postal sector plays in Africa, highlighting the evolving role of post offices in Kenya, transforming into “Huduma” (service) Centres offering access to government services for rural communities, alongside their traditional logistics functions. UPU research shows that, well optimized, postal services could contribute close to 7% to a country’s GDP, a target that is within reach of all postal administrations within the region. A 2023 report indicated that African postal industry processed over 1.2 billion items, a testament to the endurance and relevance of the sector, driven by accelerated digital transformation across the continent. PS Isaboke appreciated the UPU for its continued support to Kenya’s efforts to modernize the post services including technical and financial assistance to the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK). “Most recently, the IB of the UPU has agreed to support the Postal Corporation of Kenya to enhance its capacity in the provision of Post4Health services to the tune of Swiss Francs 150,000 (Ksh. 23,716,536.15).” He noted. He called  on the African region to harmonize its ICT policies to strengthen cross-border postal networks, share best practices, forge partnerships with tech firms, and commit to sustainability by ensuring postal systems are green and resilient."

A New Dawn for Kwale’s Fishing Sector,https://www.kbc.co.ke/a-new-dawn-for-kwales-fishing-sector/,2025-04-20T09:54:53+03:00,"Boat,fishing","Communities living along the coastal shores of Kwale County—including Tsunza, Waa, Tiwi, Mwaepe, Msambweni, Mkwiro, and Vanga—have long depended on fishing as their main source of livelihood. However, challenges such as outdated fishing gear, limited skills, and the growing impact of climate change have led to dwindling catches and low incomes, threatening the sustainability of the sector. That tide is now turning, thanks to a transformative intervention by the Kwale County Government through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, funded by the World Bank. As part of the initiative, the county has distributed 59 modern fishing boats, GPS devices, fish finders, and advanced fish value addition equipment to local fishermen. These tools have significantly boosted daily fish catches—from just 2 to 3 kilograms to over 1.5 tonnes. Governor Fatuma Achani emphasized that the program is not only aimed at increasing fish production but also at empowering the local communities economically. “This initiative is not just about increasing the quantity of fish caught. It’s about improving the livelihoods of our fishermen and their families. It’s a step toward long-term prosperity for the people of Kwale,” said Governor Achani. In addition to providing modern gear, the project has seen the construction of nine fully equipped landing sites, complete with cold storage and modern processing equipment. These mini-ports, located in areas such as Shimoni, Vanga, Gasi, Chale, and Tsunza in Kinango Sub-County, are helping reduce post-harvest losses and improve profitability. “These facilities allow our fishermen to store their catch for longer, reducing waste and increasing income,” said Roman Shera, County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The program has also focused on skills development. A total of 76 fishermen—including four women—have been trained as certified coxswains, equipping them with the expertise to engage in deep-sea fishing. “The training sessions taught us better fishing techniques, and the quality of our catch has really improved,” said Halima Hamisi, one of the newly trained coxswains. For local fishermen like Mohammed Mbogo from Tsunza, the transformation has been life-changing. “Before, we relied on outdated equipment and barely caught enough to feed our families. Now, with these new boats and tools, we can fish in deeper waters and earn a better living. It feels like a new beginning for us,” he said. The success of the KEMSFED project has injected new life into Kwale’s fishing industry, offering communities the tools, infrastructure, and training needed to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. With sustained support from the county government and development partners like the World Bank, the future of fishing in Kwale looks brighter than ever."

The board which will be chaired by Kenya National Police DT Sacco chairman David Mategwa is expected to restructure KUSCCO to enhance its efficiency and governance, recover assets and safeguard interests of Saccos and prepare the organisation for its transition into a federation. “The appointment of the new board marks a crucial step in revitalising KUSCCO and ensuring its stability and growth in alignment with the government’s cooperative sector reforms,” said Cooperatives and MSMEs Development Cabinet Secretary Wycliffe Oparanya. Following KUSCCO’s financial turmoil which revealed a Ksh 13 billion loss last year, an interim board was appointed for a period of one year to develop and implement recovery strategy as well and reconstruct books of accounts to ascertain the union’s true financial position. The interim board also oversaw completion and implementation of statutory and forensic audits and amended the union’s bylaws including recovery strategies. “KUSCCO has been able to pay about Ksh 130 million and is in the process of making more recoveries. As a ministry we are also looking at the government if it can come in and also development partners because we feel it was playing an important role,” said Oparanya. According to Oparanya, KUSCCO’s transition to a federation will ensure the Sacco umbrella body becomes an advocacy union for the Sacco sector. Oparanya has also appointed a five member Committee of Experts to help in the review of the Sacco Societies Act 2008 in order to align the law with emerging trends. The committee which is chaired by Scotland’s Capital Credit Union Chief Executive Officer Marlene Shiels is expected to propose amendments which will see the establishment of central liquidity facility to enhance financial stability of Sacco sector, create Sacco Deposit Guarantee Fund to safeguard members’ deposits and establish shared services, legal and administrative framework."

Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi said the projects which are being undertaken by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and KenGen are expected to connect 18,022 new customers to the national grid upon completion. “This will be a significant move towards providing clean, efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to the citizenry,” said Wandayi. Among targeted projects include the upgrade of Gogo Falls in Migori County by KenGen, from the current capacity of 2MW to 8.6MW. Wandayi said the upgrade is part of government’s efforts to ensure green transition. He said that even though renewable energy sources of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal account for 80pc of the national energy mix, the desire for 100pc transition to green energy by 2030 requires sustainable exploitation of the existing potential to bridge the gap. “It is out of this realisation that we purpose to capitalise on the potential of sites such as Gogo among many other renewable sources to meet the demand,” he said. Wandayi said with accelerated connectivity to the national grid comes the need for safety of the users. He said he had launched a multi-sectoral nationwide safety campaign dubbed Kaa Safe Mtaani aimed at ensuring safe use of energy. “We need to be weary of the potential dangers posed by electricity and gas, and therefore, proper usage and storage are important comments to consider in this journey,” he added. He was speaking at Gogo Falls during his maiden visit to the KenGen run plant."

Govt revokes licenses of 15 mining firms in Kilifi County,https://www.kbc.co.ke/govt-revokes-licenses-of-15-mining-firms-in-kilifi-county/,2025-04-16T10:40:29+03:00,"minerals,Mining","Mining companies operating quarries in Kilifi County are in trouble after the government revoked operating permits and licenses of fifteen companies for non compliance with mining regulations. In Jaribuni area, at least 15 companies have seen their operations halted save for Victoria Engineering that committed to give back to society by tarmacking a section of the nine-kilometer Jaribuni- Dzitsoni road that leads to the quarries. While issuing the directives after touring quarries in Jaribuni and Kalia Ng’ombe Kokotoni, Mining, Fisheries, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Hassan Joho said that some of the companies had violated regulations and were using mining permits to operate instead of mining licenses which is against the law. “The first violation I have seen is that people are using mining permits instead of mining licenses yet their operations are big. Mining licenses will require you to involve the host community and hence they hide in mining permits and I have stopped all the permits until they involve the community,” he said. Joho who was accompanied by Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung’aro and Acting Mining Principal Secretary (PS) Harry Kimutai at Jaribuni area, launched the construction of one kilometer road by Victoria Engineering, allowing the firm to continue its operation and ordered the other firms to comply before they are allowed to continue operating. Mung’aro said that he will only allow law compliant quarry operators to do business in Kilifi County for the benefit of residents. “We are working with CS Joho and we have met quarry operators and Victoria Engineering are the only ones that accepted to do us a road in Jaribuni but the rest refused and hence we have stopped them because their operations are causing untold health sufferings,” said Mung’aro. At Kalia Ng’ombe and Kokotoni areas, Joho in the company of Deputy Governor Flora Chibule and Rabai MP Kenga Mupe inspected five quarries in the area where residents have for years complained of destruction brought about by the quarry activities that include physical injuries, cracked houses due to the blasts used to crack the rocks. Residents and area government officials led by Rabai Assistant County Commissioner Ole Masaa said that 70pc of the houses in the area have developed cracks due to blasts in the quarries and demanded compensation from the firms before they could continue with their operations. “We had a multi- agency team that went round to collect data on the destructions by the quarry operators and we prepared a report but none of the firms except Mombasa Cement has complied,” said Masaa.

KALRO unveils Ksh.1.3B facility to develop wheat varieties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kalro-unveils-ksh-1-3b-facility-to-develop-wheat-varieties/,2025-04-14T12:19:46+03:00,"Agriculture,wheat production","The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has inaugurated a new Ksh 1.3 billion ($1m) research facility which is expected to boost wheat production in the country. The rust research green house facility in Njoro, Nakuru County which has been established in partnership with the the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) will enhance screening of wheat varieties to help establish the latest diseases according to CIMMYT Director General Dr. Bram Hovartz. “What we are doing is to accelerate and improve the capacity of CIMMYT and KALRO collaboration around wheat. We have screening facilities where we can test our wheat varieties for the latest diseases, so that farmers can receive wheat seed that is resistant to diseases,” said Hovartz. The facility also boasts of a cold room to store seeds and facilitate the multiplication process. “There is multiple challenges because of climate change, accelerated diseases, but also because of soil degradation. But today what I actually wanted to highlight is there’s a lot of hope. You are one of the spots in the world where we test the wheat varieties for new diseases,” he stated. KALRO Deputy Director (Crops) Dr. Felister Makini lauded the KALRO- CIMMYT partnership, saying it gears towards escalating wheat production in the country. “The capacity that they are building, both in terms of now the infrastructure, and even the scientists, is very impressive, and this is going to go a long way in increasing the production of wheat in our country,” she stated. She said although Kenya produces wheat, 80pc of the product is imported to enable the industry meet the required quantity. “As you are aware, we are importing almost 80pc of our wheat into the country, so we are looking at how we can increase productivity, especially in this day and age where climate change is a serious problem. Therefore these facilities are going to really help us increase our capacity”, she explained. Dr. Makini said the facility is vital.” As we refine and accelerate the variety, development and identification of these diseases, having a foresight on pests and diseases, is going to help impact positively in terms of identifying lines or varieties that actually can be resistant”, she added. The Deputy Director said KALRO has developed new varieties which have been released and urged wheat farmers to embrace the new varieties in order to improve production to meet local demand. “If you keep on using and recycling the same seed, the disease pressure will increase. It is likely the farmer will have even more diseased crop, which will reduce the yields. Our advice to farmers has been, at most, to use the seeds for two or three seasons. But after that, go for the certified seeds. And that is why here in Njoro, we are making great efforts to produce more seeds, especially of these new varieties”, she emphasized. Dr. Makini said KALRO has set up a Mkulima shop to enable farmers to buy the seed that is certified. She further allayed fears of genetically modified seeds, clarifying that the wheat disease outbreaks were as a result of traditional breeding. “There is no GMO here yet. So, even if you see that the crops are dying, or you see that the crops have diseases, it is not because of GMO. It is because of the traditional breeding,” she reiterated. CIMMYT Principal Scientist, Wheat Improvement Lead, East Africa Dr. Sridhar Bhavani said through research, CIMMYT has developed at least 250 varieties in the past 15 years. “A lot of the varieties that have been released in the last 15 years. We have already released over 250 odd varieties. And we are staying ahead of the game by releasing varieties even before the pathogen moves to cause devastating diseases”, Dr. Bhavani noted. He said through screening operations, CIMMYT has over the last decade, tested over 700,000 wheat accessions from all over the world. The Principal Scientist said the rust research facility will also serve as a breeding hub to enrich resistance and build future resilience for pests and diseases for newer varieties that is to be deployed not only in Kenya, but the rest of Africa as well. Dr. Bhavani said the the breeding products they develop at the Njoro facility will be exchanged through a partnership called as Wheat Improvement Network for Africa, wherein over 16 countries will receive the high-yielding varieties combining disease resistance and also climate resilience to be tested, advanced and deployed in other target environments. He stated the partnership was further targeting to assist smallholder farmers increase their yields by educating them not only on how to apply fungicides, but also make it profitable for them through conventional breeding. “So, current varieties can have a yield potential anywhere between 6 to 8 tonnes per hectare, which is almost 50 percent increase or doubling of what it used to be there with the older varieties,” Dr. Bhavani stated."
CGIAR Science Week ends with call for action on food systems,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-science-week-ends-with-call-for-action-on-food-systems/,2025-04-11T23:22:44+03:00,"CGIAR,CGIAR Science Week 2025","The CGIAR inaugural Science Week came to a close after a week dedicated to advancing science, fostering innovation and and cementing of partnerships Friday in Nairobi, Kenya.   “Over past days, we’ve explored groundbreaking research, forged new collaborations, and reaffirmed our commitment to creating sustainable, resilient, and equitable food systems. The dialogues and connections fostered here will undoubtedly propel our shared mission forward,” said Elouafi. Elouafi lauded CGIAR’s mission of empowering smallholder farmers, who produce 85pc of the world’s food, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. “Our science has always focused on inclusion and scaling innovation to the last mile,” she said, referencing strong collaborations with national institutions such as Kenya’s KALRO. “What makes our work so powerful is that it’s relevant—co-designed with local partners and rooted in local realities.” In her speech she also spotlighted emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, omics, and nanotechnology, asserting that agricultural research is on the verge of a new revolution. “We’re no longer just about yields we’re about nutrition, sustainability, and resilience,” she said, pointing to CGIAR’s shift since the Green Revolution. CGIAR Science Week, co-hosted by the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), brought together leading researchers and stakeholders to address the challenges of creating sustainable and equitable food systems.  The event underscored the transformative power of science when coupled with strategic partnerships. Throughout the event, collaboration took center stage as participants shared technologies and insights and discussed the further development of groundbreaking innovations with the potential to revolutionize agri-food systems making them more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Director General Eliud Kireger said that the debates held during the week, and showcasing of science, not only illuminated the path forward but reaffirmed a collective commitment to a food-secure future. “Through debate, presentations, and presentation of pioneering innovation, Science Week highlighted both the successes we can build on and the gaps that we are better positioned to address. The conversation doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning.” Eliud Kireger, Director General, KALRO. Key outcomes from Science Week Over the week, several key achievements took place including the CGIAR Research Portfolio launch. The launch is an ambitious and collaborative endeavor that builds on 50 years of science and partner networks to shape and focus our vision more sharply than ever through clear parameters and targets. https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ Similarly, CIMMYT and IICA signed an agreement that leverages science, technology, and collaboration to accelerate agricultural innovation and economic growth in the Americas by supporting farmers and agribusinesses. Additionally, CIP and KALRO signed a Licensing Agreement to transfer biotech for a potato resistant to late blight, reducing the need for chemical inputs while improving productivity and resilience. Significantly, it puts the development of future innovation into the hands of farmers themselves. Further, the IWMI Strategy 2024 – 2030 was launched a roadmap for research and innovation that will enhance water security throughout East Africa as well as CGIAR and AGRA signed an MOU to accelerate agricultural innovation and delivery across Africa, scaling ideas, strengthening country systems, and providing smallholder farmers with new and affordable technology. The CGIAR Flagship Report was released too designed for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries and regional bodies engaged in national, regional, and global processes, the report turns CGIAR’s science into actionable, evidence-based solutions to support better decisions and smarter investments. By building on the momentum of Science Week, CGIAR will drive tangible benefits for communities worldwide by strengthening ties with partners and funders, working to ratify key agreements, and advancing the development and scaling of innovations presented. Science must be at the heart of the solution On her part, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, noted that strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. “Strategic gatherings like Science Week help chart pathways for how we build sustainable and resilient food systems. With one-third of the global population remaining food insecure, and mounting challenges ahead, science must be at the heart of accelerating the urgent solutions we seek,” said Amina. However, a key topic throughout the week was the need to sustain and grow investment streams for agricultural research amid a challenging funding landscape. Numerous studies, including those carried out by CGIAR, clearly demonstrate that agricultural research increases production. Yet often science budgets are the first to be cut during periods of economic uncertainty. “Every $1 invested in CGIAR delivers $10 in benefits. Be it for the sustainability of our planet or out of simple economic sense, investing in CGIAR’s centers and working ever more closely together is one of the smartest investments we can make. In our future, for our future,” said Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The world is at a crossroads, and cannot meet complex and interconnected challenges without transforming food systems. Yet with the right investment agriculture, as outlined in the CGIAR Investment Case, has the potential to be humanity’s biggest solution to global agri-challenges. Investments of $4bn over 2025-2027 are urgently needed to unlock the power of science and innovation to tackle climate change, increase productivity, and help transform food, land, and water systems to be able to address the pressing challenges of today. By gathering stakeholders, policymakers, experts, innovators, and farmers in one place, Science Week made great inroads into advancing vital themes. At a time when climate, food, and health systems are under strain, Science Week reaffirmed that science, when guided by purpose and delivered through strong partnerships, has the power to transform, proving that strength lies in collaboration that turns insights into action, and action into impact.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/ https://www.kbc.co.ke/science-week-kenya-stresses-science-as-key-to-ending-hunger/"

In a bid to secure the continent’s labour market, experts at the Eleventh Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) meeting in Kampala, Uganda organized by the United Nations Economic Commission (ECA) are now calling for strategic investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives tailored for youth and informal sector workers to meet industry requirements. “The tangible effects of climate change – rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation – are already destabilizing job security, forcing communities to relocate, and widening the gap between the rich and poor,” said Andrew Mundalo Allieu, Senior Economist, International Labour Organization Regional Office for Africa. According to ILO, at least 1.2 billion workers whose livelihoods depend on the natural environment are at risk worldwide. Further study by the organization shows that heat stress for instance is causing a 2.3pc loss in working hours, a figure projected to escalate to 14 million lost jobs by 2030. The investments which will require collaborations are expected to foster innovative financing to support green projects and strengthening social protection systems to provide vital safety nets for vulnerable communities. “Public-private partnerships are vital to mobilizing investment and fostering innovation in green sectors, while gender-inclusive approaches are essential to ensure that women equitably benefit from the green transition through participation in decision-making and access to skills development,” said Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO of Sterling One Foundation. Among sectors where employments risks are averse include agriculture, constriction and services sectors which employ 83pc of African workforce and are more susceptible to climate related shocks. “As climate change disrupts yields and redefines commodity value, aligning supply chains with regional strengths can reduce risk and boost shared prosperity. Although the costs of renewables are falling, uncertainty still poses challenges. Early investment and coordinated actions are essential to secure resilient and inclusive green jobs,” added Etienne Espagne, Senior Climate Economist at the World Bank. The carbon market alone is projected to support up to 400 million jobs by 2050."

CBK Governor Kamau Thugge says a strong balance of payments, solid export base and capital inflows are some of the factors supporting the Kenyan unit, which has hovered around Ksh 129 to the dollar for months now, despite worsening global geo-politics. According to the regulator, Kenya’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the shilling remaining relatively stable against the US dollar in recent months despite ongoing global markets and currency volatility. In the last 7 months, the shilling has been trading at 129 to the dollar despite the ongoing global trade war between the US and leading economic powers like China and the European Union. Thugge says the recently imposed a 10pc reciprocal tariff by the United States will have minimal impact on the Kenyan economy, though exports to the US are likely to drop by close to Ksh 100 million dollars. On the domestic front, the Governor expressed concerns over the rising level of non-performing loans, which now stands at 17.2pc, urging commercial banks to increase lending to the private sector. The CBK Governor further says National Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are negotiating a loan facility with Kenya to easy supply side pressures. On the state of the domestic banking market, CBK says it is conducting onsite inspections on risk-based pricing for all commercial lenders in the country, with mixed results."

This has resulted in an uncoordinated development agenda between the global North and South. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director Dr Mithika Mwenda says incoherent policies can lead to unintended consequences like funding green initiatives while investing in fossil fuels, tightening migration policies and promoting labor mobility policies. According to the Climate Finance Initiative report dubbed Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa 2024, Climate financing for Africa grew by 48pc to USD 44 billion in 2021/22. However, this is only a quarter of what is required to realize its 2030 goals. Experts say that climate action, economic growth and social policies should be designed to strengthen each other rather than creating new vulnerabilities and gaps. Addressing a meeting convened by the European Union Parliament, Dr. Mwenda urged the European Parliament to engage transparently with the global south to ensure commitments are met and financing is predictable and easily accessible. Mithika noted that the Global Gateway Initiative, which targets to mobilize up to €300 billion in investments through a Team Europe approach, should be structured in a manner that enhances global north-south relations. “This is in addition to the Global Gateway initiative, aiming to “enable African countries to integrate their raw materials and resources into sustainable global value chains” by 2030. While, for instance, 63pc of the world’s cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, without mentioning other global south countries providing critical Raw Minerals, it is the best opportunity to advance a just, equitable and inclusive transition.” Dr. Mithika said. The PACJA Executive Director further said Parliamentary debates, sessions, and committee hearings should include voices from Africa and the global south in general to ensure perspectives from affected countries are considered and shape the EU policies. The meeting has also said EU parliaments must push for trade and investment agreements that promote shared prosperity rather than exploitative relationships."
"Kenya, Israel ink deal on renewable energy development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-israel-ink-deal-on-renewable-energy-development/,2025-04-09T15:17:27+03:00,"energy,Renewable Energy","Kenya and Israel have agreed on a joint renewable energy development which will see the two countries collaborate in enhancing human and technical capacity in the sector. Under the five year Memorandum of Understanding signed between between Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi and Israel Ambassador to to Kenya Michael Lotem, Israel has committed to support Kenya in production of sustainable renewable energy through capacity building for technical and offering professional support as well as sharing experiences of the latest cutting edge technology in the energy sector. “With the signing of this understanding, we have established a framework through which we will collaborate to facilitate and encourage cooperation in the energy sector as well as share expertise in renewable energy resources development, innovation to improve reliability and quality of the distribution network and utilization for economic growth that is based on principles of impartiality, equality, reciprocity and common interest,” said Wandayi. Israel also plans to support Kenya in minimizing technical and commercial losses by sharing its expertise in renewable power storage and grid stabilisation to improve output into the grid. Latest data by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) indicates that technical losses which occur in transmission and distribution lines rose to 24.2pc in six months of the year to December 2024, far above the 17.5pc threshold. On the other hand, Kenya is still grappling with commercial losses which arise from illegal connections unmetered connections, unread meters and meter tampering. The agreement also targets to build the country’s capacity by improving professional training schools and establishing collaboration with universities and colleges of human capital development. Isreal will also help Kenya set up a Centre of Excellence for energy where human capital will be honned for the country’s sustainability of the green energy. “It is the only surest way to through which as a country you will sustain the transition to green power” said Lotem. According to EPRA, renewable energy currently makes up 81.2pc of Kenya’s total installed capacity of 3,192MW."
"CGIAR launches portfolio to tackle global food, climate challenges",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cgiar-launches-portfolio-to-tackle-global-food-climate-challenges/,2025-04-09T15:35:25+03:00,"CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio,Climate Change","CGIAR has launched its 2025–2030 Research Portfolio Tuesday unveiling a blueprint to reshape global food, water and land systems amid escalating hunger, climate change and inequality. The new portfolio unveiled at the inaugural CGIAR Science Week in Nairobi is designed not just to adapt to today’s pressing needs but to actively shape a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. The new phase of CGIAR action is more collaborative, focused, and ambitious, building on 50 years of science expertise and its extensive partner networks. Speaking during the launch at the United Nations Complex in Gigirin Nairobi, CGIAR Executive Managing Director, Ismahane Elouafi noted that the new portfolio unites the work of all CGIAR Centers into a single strategic platform comprising of eight science programs, one scaling program and four accelerators which reflects a renewed commitment to delivering transformative solutions . “The portfolio is more than a set of programs and accelerators. It is a unified platform designed for impact. It reflects our renewed commitment to not only improving productivity but also nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and social equity,” said Elouafi. According to Elouafi, the Research Portfolio is a direct response to global calls for action by world leaders, science experts, and farmers on the frontline of today’s agricultural crises. Anchored in frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 2025 Paris Agreement, and the Global Biodiversity Framework, the Research Portfolio reflects the reality that today’s food systems can no longer deliver nutrition, equity, or sustainability for our growing populations. The Research Portfolio aims to equip them with the tools, knowledge, and resilience they need to thrive, with smallholder farmers in the Global South being the most affected. With a global workforce of over 10,000 staff across 80+ countries and a wide network of partnerships, CGIAR is uniquely positioned to coordinate a global response powered by pioneering agricultural science. On her part, CGIAR Chief Scientist Sandra Milach highlighted that the Research Portfolio is established around Science Programs focused on critical needs, a Scaling for Impact Program to ensure innovation is widely adopted, and accelerators to boost both research and technology adoption. “50 years ago, we turned to science for solutions,” said Milach, “The CGIAR centers were created to help farmers produce food, and together with our partners, have since saved millions of lives in Africa and Asia. However, the world is different now. We are facing climate change, biodiversity loss and new conflicts. Once again, we will need to build capabilities to be able to address these new problems. Today, we must develop research that can truly address these issues.” Combined, these components aggregate expertise and partnerships around high-priority targets to collectively deliver scalable solutions that tackle the most pressing global agricultural challenges. The stakeholders know best A key strength of the Research Portfolio is its collaborative design developed alongside key
stakeholders such as national agricultural research institutions and the farmers themselves. Through global “Listening Sessions” and consultations with governments, regional bodies, national research institutions, and local farming communities, CGIAR ensures the portfolio reflects real-world needs and responds to priorities at national,
regional, and global levels. The design also builds on analysis of CGIAR’s cutting-edge innovations and technologies that factor in current discourse on global agricultural needs and challenges from shifting diets and demographics to climate volatility and geopolitical shocks. The result is a forward-looking research and innovation agenda that integrates science, policy, and
partnerships to achieve lasting impact. CGIAR’s 2025-30 Portfolio will benefit food, land and water systems across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by accelerating agricultural productivity growth, leading to better-functioning markets, strengthened livelihoods and new job and income opportunities for workers in the agrifood system, especially women. It builds on a solid foundation of existing work while expanding into emerging areas of science with potential for impact, helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty while supporting low-income producers and consumers for the decades to come. Stakeholders know best  At the heart of the new strategy is a collaborative design process informed by global “Listening Sessions,” ensuring that innovations are locally relevant and globally scalable. The inclusion of accelerators also signals CGIAR’s intention to move research beyond experimentation into real-world application bridging the gap between science and adoption.

Speaking at the World Chambers Federation Africa Summit 2025, President Ruto said called on the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) through its devolved chapters to champion pro-business reforms, eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks in order to support local entrepreneurs in the 47 counties. “To encourage this, we are developing a County Ease of Doing Business Index to drive healthy competition, accountability, and progress,” he stated. Among processes the government is seeking to support counties in adopting, is the Unified Business Permit which has since been rolled out in Nairobi County. According to the President, chambers of commerce are critical in bringing proactive and solutions-oriented perspective which foster economic growth through public and private sector linkages. President Ruto further highlighted the role of chambers in helping businesses navigate risk, unlock
opportunities, and expand into global markets. “In Kenya, we fully embrace this transformation. In 2022, 41pc of our exports were destined for African countries. Our manufacturers and tech start-ups are expanding across the region, demonstrating our strong conviction that Kenya’s and Africa’s economic fortunes lie in intra-African trade and cooperation,” he added. Kenya backs its investments in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and border posts to markets, fibre-optic networks, and renewable energy to continue supporting enterprise in order to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost exports and enhance economic growth."

Kapkoros Tea Factory has been involved in a wrangle with two of its subsidiaries, Motigo and Olenguruone whose farmers had boycotted plucking and delivering their green leaf  to the factory demanding for financial and operational independence. Following a meeting convened on Tuesday by Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, Motigo and Olenguruone tea factories will now operate as independent entities. “That the directors agree on the modalities of separation, to take due cognizance of all the issues obtaining, and exercise fairness in the discharge of their responsibilities,” said Kagwe. On December 15, 2023, farmers from Motigo and Olenguruone had voted for separation of their accounts and financial autonomy from Kapkoros which was subsequently approved in the Annual General Meeting held on December 12, last year. The resolution also received overwhelming support from Kapkoros Tea Factory Board during the meeting held on January 9, this year. During today’s meeting, Kagwe also directed farmers from Motigo and Olenguruone to immediately resume
plucking and delivery of green leaf to their respective factories. “That henceforth, all parties cease hostilities against each other and stop engaging in any action that may interfere with normal operations or management of the 4 tea factories, and withdraw all active petitions, and court cases,” added Kagwe. Coding and issuance of the smart cards to farmers in the two factories is also set to proceed as earlier planned. Under the deal, Kamogoso Tea factory which also manages Tirgaga Tea Factory shall support construction of Kamogoso Tea Factory and modernize old factories with government assistance. Additionally, directors, in conjunction with their management agent, Kenya Tea Development Agency are expected to take urgent measures to address the high cost of production in all the four factories based in Bomet County, and also enhance the quality of teas. Kagwe further warns that factories found to be perpetuating the hawking of green leaf tea to be delicensed in accordance with the Tea Act, 2020."
Kenya’s retail market evolves as Adidas originals opens at Westgate Mall,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-retail-market-evolves-as-adidas-originals-opens-at-westgate-mall/,2025-04-07T17:31:50+03:00,"Adidas,Westgate Mall","Kenya continues to position itself as a key destination for international brands, with the latest entrant being Adidas Originals. The globally recognized sports and lifestyle brand has officially expanded its presence in Kenya with a new store at Westgate Mall in Westlands, introduced by WAMA International Group. This move reflects a broader trend of global brands entering or expanding in Kenya. Companies such as Nike, Puma, and Levi’s already have a presence in the country, capitalizing on Kenya’s growing middle class and increasing consumer demand for high-quality lifestyle and fashion products. Westgate Mall, which hosts over 80 stores, has become a prime location for such brands looking to establish a foothold in the region. The rise of Westgate Mall as a premier retail hub is particularly significant given its history. The mall was the site of a tragic terror attack in 2013, an event that tested Nairobi’s resilience. However, the mall has since been rebuilt and re-imagined, emerging as a symbol of strength and economic revival. Today, it stands as one of Nairobi’s leading shopping destinations, attracting both global brands and local entrepreneurs eager to tap into Kenya’s dynamic retail market. Kenya’s fashion industry has experienced significant growth, influenced by both international and local trends. While global brands continue to expand their presence, the local market is highly competitive, with both original and non-original brands vying for consumer attention. Counterfeit products, often sold at lower prices, present a challenge for premium brands like Adidas, which emphasize quality, authenticity, and innovation. At the same time, Kenya’s local manufacturing sector is working to carve out a space in the fashion industry. Designers and entrepreneurs are pushing for “Made in Kenya” products, with a focus on sustainable fashion, locally sourced materials, and unique African-inspired designs. However, they face stiff competition from established global brands, both in terms of brand recognition and consumer preference. WAMA International, a retail company with over 30 stores across different regions, says it has ambitious expansion plans in East Africa. The opening of Adidas Originals in Nairobi underscores the confidence international investors have in Kenya’s retail market, driven by a strong consumer base and a steadily growing economy. The new Adidas Originals store aims to enhance the shopping experience with a curated selection of lifestyle footwear, apparel, and accessories for both men and women. The store’s strategic location within Westgate Mall allows it to tap into the mall’s high foot traffic and diverse customer base. The grand opening on April 4 was marked by a lively launch event featuring live entertainment, DJ performances, sneaker customization, and a celebration of local culture. The event reflected Adidas’ commitment to creativity, inclusion, and sustainability while aligning with Nairobi’s vibrant urban scene. As global brands tailor their offerings to local preferences, Adidas Originals’ entry into the Kenyan market follows a similar approach. Companies like Carrefour and LC Waikiki have successfully adapted their business models to resonate with Kenyan consumers, reinforcing the country’s growing reputation as a lucrative retail destination. “It has been a great experience to partner with WAMA International Group and bring the first adidas Originals standalone store to Nairobi. As a brand, we are committed to expanding our presence in Africa and making a positive impact in the communities we serve,” said Brett Burgess, Senior Director, Africa Export, EM South. Ismael Elmahdy, Head of Retail at WAMA International Group, shared his enthusiasm, stating, “We are thrilled to launch our first Adidas Originals store in East Africa. This marks a significant milestone in our expansion strategy, and we look forward to offering Kenyan consumers world-class products and experiences.” The Adidas Originals store is now open on the first floor of Westgate Mall, Nairobi, joining a growing list of international brands that view Kenya as a strategic market in Africa. Meanwhile, the country’s local fashion industry continues to evolve, balancing tradition, innovation, and competition with global players."
Seafarers to get key document to expand job opportunities ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/seafarers-to-get-key-document-to-expand-job-opportunities/,2025-04-07T15:28:19+03:00,,"The government is in the process of making Seafarers Identification Documents which will enable seafarers to work in foreign countries, according to Labour Cabinet Secretary Dr. Alfred Mutua. Speaking at an induction workshop for the Seafarers’ and Wages Council in Kilifi County, Dr Mutua said lack of the document make it for local seafarers to seek carriers in other territories despite numerous available opportunities. “Just like to any other professional another critical issue to Seafarers is the Seafarers Identity Document (SID). Without this document, securing opportunities to work outside the country in the maritime sector is extremely difficult. I will ensure that those without it receive the necessary support to obtain it to unlock access to job opportunities abroad,” said Dr Mutua. He said the maritime sector offers a wide range of employment opportunities in areas such as fishing, sea freight and cruise ships which they youth could explore. This comes as the government commits to address unique challenges faced by seafarers with the establishment of the Seafarers’ Wages Council. “For far too long, the men and women who power the maritime sector, our seafarers have faced numerous challenges including precarious employment conditions, low wages and inadequate social protection,” Mutua said. However, Mutua said one of the major challenges in seafarer training is the lack of dedicated training vessels and therefore urged ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to ensure they are fully equipped with the necessary skills upon completing their courses. “The training which is currently conducted is not real training unless there’s practicals. I therefore ship owners to offer free practical training to trainees to prepare them for employment,” he said. The wages council is mandated with providing economic policy interventions as well as job creation by ensuring the existence of a well-regulated and attractive working environment which will encourage more Kenyans to pursue careers in the maritime industry. The council will also ensure fair wages and decent working conditions to seafarers as per the Employment Act, enhance Kenya’s competitiveness as a maritime nation by attracting the training skill maritime profession, strengthen the protection of seafarer’s rights by promoting their welfare and dignity and also enforce a social dialogue among employers, employees and relevant government institutions to maintain industrial harmony in the maritime sector. The CS urged the council to adopt best practices from successful maritime nations and continuously engage in capacity-building initiatives. “To discharge your mandate, you should strive to carry out comparative learning in other successful countries and engage in continuous capacity building which is the pillar of providing a forum for members to discuss, consult and make crucial decisions while equipping them with adequate governance skills, he noted."
Manufacturers urged to leverage US tariff move to boost exports,https://www.kbc.co.ke/manufacturers-urged-to-leverage-us-tariff-move-to-boost-exports/,2025-04-07T14:34:11+03:00,"Tariff,trade","Agro-processors should take advantage of the reciprocal tariffs on a number of countries by the US and increase exports to America. Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) says the tariff increase to 10pc imposed on Kenyan products is significantly lower than the rates Kenya’s major competitors in the US textile market face. Kenya is among 185 countries that were slapped with tariff increases ranging from 10 to 50pc by the US government. Trade between Kenya and the U.S. is estimated to reach Ksh 177 billion with Kenya exporting Ksh 64.3 billion worth of goods while buying products worth Ksh 112.8 billion. Textiles, apparel, and coffee, account for over 40pc of Kenya’s exports to the U.S. market. KNCCI says the move by the US government to increase tariffs on a number of nations will open up the market more Kenyan textile and apparel products. According to the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the 10pc tariff on Kenyan products is significantly lower than the rates facing Vietnam ( at 46pc), Sri Lanka (at 44pc), Bangladesh (at 37pc), China (at 34pc), Pakistan (at 29pc), and India (at 26pc), which are Kenya’s major competitors in textile manufacturing. Textile and apparel manufacturers have been encouraged to invest in facility upgrades, value-addition processes, and workforce development to meet anticipated increased demand. To mitigate against the new tariffs, manufacturers have been advised to increase value addition on coffee, tea, and horticultural goods destined for the US market. However the chamber admits that the 10pc tariff will increase costs for exporters in the short term denying them much needed capital for expansion. KNCCI further warns that any additional long-term protectionism policies by the US will reduce Kenya exporters market access, urging exporters to expand their international market."

Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir says the bond which will be floated within the next 90 days will target both domestic and eternal bond markets. In the meantime, Chirchir says the government has secured Ksh 74 billion bridge facility from Trade Development Bank and Afreximbank through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to begin immediate payment to contractors under a structured settlement agreement in order to facilitate commencement of stalled road projects across the country. “We are paying them today 40pc of what we owe them through the bridge facility and we expect them to go back to work on all the roads where there are those contracts. We that would shortly be seeing all the road contractors back to work. The first bridge facility of about Ksh 74 billion is basically done. We have received Ksh 63b today and through a structured settlement agreement which is a return to work formula,” said Chirchir. According to Chirchir, the loan which has attracted an interest of 7.8pc for a period of two years is expected to be cleared with proceeds from the infrastructure bond which will be floated on both the domestic and the international market. 80pc of the funds will be raised on the external bond market with the balance from the domestic market. For both the bridge facility and the bond, Chirchir says the government will use the Ksh 7 shillings added on the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF) in July last year as security. “What we have done with the approval of Parliament giving us the additional Ksh 7 of the roads maintenance levy on top of the current Ksh 18 sometimes in July last year was to take a bold decision to securitize the Ksh 7 to raise about Ksh 175 billion through a bond issuance but we have structured it with the bridge facility that brings in a loan facility quickly to be able to pay the contractors, get them back to work and get work on all these roads starting again,” added Chirchir. Chirchir says out of the Ksh 55 billion which was appropriated to clear pending bills by the excheuers, only Ksh 35 billion has been paid. According to projections by the Kenya Roads Board (KRB), the annual RMLF revenue will increase to Ksh 115 billion from the Ksh 25 being charged on petrol and diesel."

Agriculture and Livestock Development Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe says the decision to allow importation of yellow maize is on the backdrop limited maize supply which is not able to sustain demand by animal feeds and maize flour millers. “As a result of this increasing demand, the price of a 90 kilogram bag of maize has risen by approximately 26pc compared to three months ago. This upward trend in maize prices has directly impacted the cost of production, prompting millers to pass the increased costs onto consumers through higher prices of maize flour (unga),” said Kagwe in a statement released on Friday. Kagwe says the government will gazette the directive which will allow a list of vetted animal feed millers to import non-genetically modified yellow maize at 50pc duty waiver for a period of one year. “The objective is to reduce pressure on local white maize stocks by shifting animal feed millers to yellow maize. This will allow millers focused on human consumption to access available maize at fairer prices, ultimately leading to reduced production costs and more stable unga prices for consumers,” he added. The ministry is also urging farmers to consider cultivating yellow maize for animal feed industry to meet annual domestic demand estimated at over 1 million metric tonnes and cut dependency on imports. Kagwe said the government will also release regular maize from the National Strategic Food Reserve to millers producing maize flour for human consumption in bid to cushion consumers from rising unga prices."
Who might buy TikTok as ban deadline looms? Amazon joins bidders,https://www.kbc.co.ke/who-might-buy-tiktok-as-ban-deadline-looms-amazon-joins-bidders/,2025-04-04T09:37:41+03:00,"social media,TikTok","President Donald Trump says he is “very close” to brokering a deal to find a buyer for TikTok, which faces a US ban if its Chinese owner does not sell the app by the weekend. A bipartisan law passed by Congress last year mandates TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sell the app. The platform ‘went dark’ for a day in January in the US after the law took effect, until Trump intervened and delayed the ban until 5 April. The US government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because Chinese authorities might access its vast trove of user data, which Beijing denies. Who might buy TikTok?
Speaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said “multiple investors” were closing in on a deal. He also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports. Several potential buyers have cropped up in reports. Amazon has put in a last-minute offer to the White House to acquire TikTok, according to the BBC’s US partner CBS. Amazon declined to comment. Trump has said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk, although the latter said he had no intention of buying. Other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O’Leary – a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons’ Den. Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X last month that he had joined Mr McCourt’s bid. The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson – AKA MrBeast – has also said he’s looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors. Tim Stokely, the British founder of OnlyFans, has also to offered to buy TikTok under his recently re-launched company, Zoop. Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. The White House has reportedly considered an option whereby ByteDance would keep ownership of TikTok’s algorithm, but lease it to a new entity operating the video-sharing app within the US. If there is no deal, will TikTok be banned?
If no deal is reached by 5 April, the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from app stores. Trump signed an executive order in January, which only delayed TikTok’s ban by 75 days. His order did not overturn the ban on the app passed into law by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court. Trump could allow the law to stand, but ask the Department of Justice to continue to ignore it. The government would effectively be telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok on to their devices.

Kenya mulls boosting manufacturing capacity after US tariff move,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-mulls-boosting-manufacturing-capacity-after-us-tariff-move/,2025-04-03T17:00:36+03:00,"Textile and Apparel,trade","Kenya is anticipating increased costs of production in the textile and apparel sector in the wake of a 10pc tariff imposed on the country’s exports to the United States. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs to at least 60 countries exporting their products to the US including those from Kenya. According to Investments, Trade and Industry Cabinet Secretary Lee Kinyanjui, the move by the US is likely to lead to higher costs for Kenyan manufacturers with expected rise in demand for cheaper Kenyan products compared to competing countries in the space which have significantly higher tariffs. “While the 10pc tariff is lower than the competitors’ tariffs, it still raises costs for Kenyan businesses exporting to the US. Supply chain adjustments will be necessary such as expanding production to meet new demand. This will require investment in infrastructure, technology and skills development,” said Kinyanjui. Following the tariff reciprocation, Kenya is now seeking to position itself as key textile and apparel manufacturing hub which could see the country become a primary source for American buyers after key textile and apparel export juggernauts in Asia received higher duties for their products. Chinese imports to the US were slapped with a 34pc tariff, Vietnam 46pc, Bangladesh 37pc, Sri Lanka 44pc, Pakistan 29pc and India 26pc. “With other textile-exporting countries facing much higher tariffs, Kenya could position itself as an alternative sourcing hub for US buyers. This represents an opportunity for investment in local textile production and value addition that could attract businesses seeking to avoid higher costs from traditional suppliers,” added Kinyanjui. Kenya is also targeting to diversify its exports base by exploring opportunities to process and manufacture goods that are now more expensive from countries with higher tariffs. “Industries such as apparel, leather and agro-processing could benefit from increased demand” added Kinyanjui. Kinyanjui said his ministry is also engaging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders in the industry to identify key products and encourage investment in targeted sectors in a bid to enhance Kenya’s exports to various markets. The US has been a key export market for Kenya’s textile, apparel and leather under the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA) over the past 25 years. In January alone, exports to the US under the preferential trade deal amounted to Ksh 7.2 billion according to AGOA.Info."
