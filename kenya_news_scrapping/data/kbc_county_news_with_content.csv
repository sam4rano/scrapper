"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation.

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year.

Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year.

Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

"Western MPs defend NG-CDF and NGAAF, say funds fuel local development projects",https://www.kbc.co.ke/western-mps-defend-ng-cdf-and-ngaaf-say-funds-fuel-local-development-projects/,2025-05-03T16:44:40+03:00,"NG-CDF,NGAAF","Leaders from the Western region have reaffirmed their support for the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NGCDF) and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), describing them as lifelines for grassroots development. Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

"Western MPs defend NG-CDF and NGAAF, say funds fuel local development projects",https://www.kbc.co.ke/western-mps-defend-ng-cdf-and-ngaaf-say-funds-fuel-local-development-projects/,2025-05-03T16:44:40+03:00,"NG-CDF,NGAAF","Leaders from the Western region have reaffirmed their support for the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NGCDF) and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), describing them as lifelines for grassroots development. Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."
Mama Kitchen Garden: Boosting Food Security and Nutrition in Schools and Households,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mama-kitchen-garden-boosting-food-security-and-nutrition-in-schools-and-households/,2025-05-03T08:05:34+03:00,"Africa,Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh","Food security remains one of Africa’s most urgent challenges, with millions facing hunger and inadequate nutrition. In Kenya, nearly 30% of households are food insecure—particularly in arid and semi-arid regions—while malnutrition among children persists at alarming levels. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 18% of children under five are stunted, 10% are underweight, 5% suffer from wasting, and 3% are overweight—painting a grim picture of the nation’s nutritional well-being. In response to this crisis, First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, through her flagship Mama Kitchen Garden initiative—supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development—is championing efforts to enhance food security and improve nutrition at the household and school level. The initiative promotes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, agritech innovation, climate-smart farming, and women’s economic empowerment. It encourages families and learning institutions to embrace kitchen gardens as a sustainable way to access fresh, nutritious food while fostering agricultural education. Speaking during the National Mama Kitchen Garden Private Sector and Development Partners Breakfast Meeting held at the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Headquarters, Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh emphasized the need for a coordinated and inclusive approach to ensure long-term impact. He highlighted the value of school kitchen gardens as “outdoor laboratories,” offering students hands-on learning in soil testing, plant growth, pest control, and sustainable farming. “Experiential learning fosters curiosity, innovation, and paves the way for the next generation of agricultural scientists and environmental stewards,” said Dr. Ronoh. He also noted the initiative’s potential to create mentorship opportunities by connecting students with seasoned farmers and agricultural experts in structured, knowledge-sharing platforms. For urban families and schools with limited space, Dr. Ronoh encouraged the adoption of vertical farming and hydroponics as innovative solutions to boost food production in constrained environments. Elizabeth Koskei, CEO of Mama Doing Good, the organization implementing the initiative jointly with the State Department for Agriculture, said the Mama Kitchen Garden is rooted in the belief that women, families, and communities have the power to transform their lives through self-reliance and nutrition-focused farming. “Our vision is that every household—regardless of income or space—can cultivate a small garden and enjoy the dignity of healthy, homegrown food,” she stated. Key stakeholders present at the event—including KALRO Director General Dr. Eliud Kireger and Kenya Seed Company Managing Director Sammy Chepsiror reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Mama Kitchen Garden and scaling up food security solutions across Kenya. The official launch of the National Mama Kitchen Garden is scheduled for 9th May, 2025, at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) in Koibatek, Baringo County."

Speaking at Athi River Primary School during the Chief’s Climate Action Day, Dr. Omollo emphasized that protecting children from early school leaving, drugs, and exploitation must take precedence in national discourse. “Our children are our greatest resource. We cannot afford to lose them to drugs, crime, or hopelessness. Parents have sacrificed so much to keep them in school. As government, we are committed to ensuring that every child not only attends school but is protected from all forms of exploitation,” he said. He urged national government administrators to work closely with school leadership, parents’ associations, and religious groups to keep children in class and prevent school dropouts, noting that the Ministry will intensify interventions at the local level. Dr. Omollo also condemned the rising cases of drug and substance abuse, especially along highway towns like Athi River, which expose children and youth to illegal activities. He warned traffickers and unscrupulous businesspeople that the government will not allow a generation to be destroyed for profit. At the same event, the PS led a symbolic tree planting exercise under the Chief’s Climate Action Day, a monthly national initiative aimed at achieving President William Ruto’s vision of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He praised Machakos County for being among the best-performing regions despite environmental challenges. “We came here not just to plant trees, but to plant hope and restore dignity. Education and climate action go hand in hand because without a safe, educated generation, we cannot talk about sustainable development,” he noted. Dr. Omollo called on local industries in Machakos to support education and environmental programs, stating that private sector players must invest in the communities they operate in. The event brought together county officials, the leadership of Athi River Primary and Junior Secondary schools, chiefs and assistant chiefs, and representatives from NACADA and NDOC."

The vehicle was found with 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol carefully concealed under cartons of milk in an apparent attempt to deceive law enforcement. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA), led by its CEO Dr. Anthony Omerikwa, speaking at the scene, said. “This was not just an attempt to break the law; it was an intentional move to endanger lives,” Dr. Omerikwa said. “We will not relent in pursuing those involved in the manufacture, trafficking, and sale of illegal or uncustomised substances. Their assets will be traced and seized under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering framework.” Samples of the seized liquid have been dispatched to the Government Chemist for analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest the ethanol was being trafficked for possible use in the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Dr. Omerikwa commended the swift action and coordination by the local police command and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), stating, “This successful operation is a testament to what inter-agency collaboration can achieve. I applaud our partners in the police and KRA for their vigilance and commitment to public safety.” He emphasised the need for enhanced intelligence sharing across government agencies, noting, “More seizures and apprehensions are possible if we break silos and pool our efforts. The networks fueling this trade thrive on communication gaps. We must close them.” The CEO further urged the public to be part of the fight by reporting suspicious activity anonymously through NACADA’s toll-free hotline 1192. “Community support is crucial. Let us protect our youth and safeguard the future,” he said. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origins and intended destination of the intercepted substance as NACADA and its partners ramp up efforts to dismantle the networks behind Kenya’s illicit drug trade."

The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

"CS Ruku vows to deepen public service reforms, mainstream Article 232",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cs-ruku-vows-to-deepen-public-service-reforms-mainstream-article-232/,2025-05-05T13:35:15+03:00,,"Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Human Capital Development and Special Programmes, Geoffrey Ruku, has reaffirmed his commitment to enhancing public service delivery across the country, with a particular focus on marginalized regions. Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added.

Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees.

The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."

In Kenya, nearly 30% of households are food insecure—particularly in arid and semi-arid regions—while malnutrition among children persists at alarming levels. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 18% of children under five are stunted, 10% are underweight, 5% suffer from wasting, and 3% are overweight—painting a grim picture of the nation’s nutritional well-being. In response to this crisis, First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, through her flagship Mama Kitchen Garden initiative—supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development—is championing efforts to enhance food security and improve nutrition at the household and school level. The initiative promotes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, agritech innovation, climate-smart farming, and women’s economic empowerment. It encourages families and learning institutions to embrace kitchen gardens as a sustainable way to access fresh, nutritious food while fostering agricultural education. Speaking during the National Mama Kitchen Garden Private Sector and Development Partners Breakfast Meeting held at the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Headquarters, Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh emphasized the need for a coordinated and inclusive approach to ensure long-term impact. He highlighted the value of school kitchen gardens as “outdoor laboratories,” offering students hands-on learning in soil testing, plant growth, pest control, and sustainable farming. “Experiential learning fosters curiosity, innovation, and paves the way for the next generation of agricultural scientists and environmental stewards,” said Dr. Ronoh. He also noted the initiative’s potential to create mentorship opportunities by connecting students with seasoned farmers and agricultural experts in structured, knowledge-sharing platforms. For urban families and schools with limited space, Dr. Ronoh encouraged the adoption of vertical farming and hydroponics as innovative solutions to boost food production in constrained environments. Elizabeth Koskei, CEO of Mama Doing Good, the organization implementing the initiative jointly with the State Department for Agriculture, said the Mama Kitchen Garden is rooted in the belief that women, families, and communities have the power to transform their lives through self-reliance and nutrition-focused farming. “Our vision is that every household—regardless of income or space—can cultivate a small garden and enjoy the dignity of healthy, homegrown food,” she stated. Key stakeholders present at the event—including KALRO Director General Dr. Eliud Kireger and Kenya Seed Company Managing Director Sammy Chepsiror reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Mama Kitchen Garden and scaling up food security solutions across Kenya. The official launch of the National Mama Kitchen Garden is scheduled for 9th May, 2025, at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) in Koibatek, Baringo County."

Speaking at Athi River Primary School during the Chief’s Climate Action Day, Dr. Omollo emphasized that protecting children from early school leaving, drugs, and exploitation must take precedence in national discourse. “Our children are our greatest resource. We cannot afford to lose them to drugs, crime, or hopelessness. Parents have sacrificed so much to keep them in school. As government, we are committed to ensuring that every child not only attends school but is protected from all forms of exploitation,” he said. He urged national government administrators to work closely with school leadership, parents’ associations, and religious groups to keep children in class and prevent school dropouts, noting that the Ministry will intensify interventions at the local level. Dr. Omollo also condemned the rising cases of drug and substance abuse, especially along highway towns like Athi River, which expose children and youth to illegal activities. He warned traffickers and unscrupulous businesspeople that the government will not allow a generation to be destroyed for profit. At the same event, the PS led a symbolic tree planting exercise under the Chief’s Climate Action Day, a monthly national initiative aimed at achieving President William Ruto’s vision of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He praised Machakos County for being among the best-performing regions despite environmental challenges. “We came here not just to plant trees, but to plant hope and restore dignity. Education and climate action go hand in hand because without a safe, educated generation, we cannot talk about sustainable development,” he noted. Dr. Omollo called on local industries in Machakos to support education and environmental programs, stating that private sector players must invest in the communities they operate in.

The vehicle was found with 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol carefully concealed under cartons of milk in an apparent attempt to deceive law enforcement. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA), led by its CEO Dr. Anthony Omerikwa, speaking at the scene, said. “This was not just an attempt to break the law; it was an intentional move to endanger lives,” Dr. Omerikwa said. “We will not relent in pursuing those involved in the manufacture, trafficking, and sale of illegal or uncustomised substances. Their assets will be traced and seized under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering framework.” Samples of the seized liquid have been dispatched to the Government Chemist for analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest the ethanol was being trafficked for possible use in the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Dr. Omerikwa commended the swift action and coordination by the local police command and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), stating, “This successful operation is a testament to what inter-agency collaboration can achieve. I applaud our partners in the police and KRA for their vigilance and commitment to public safety.” He emphasised the need for enhanced intelligence sharing across government agencies, noting, “More seizures and apprehensions are possible if we break silos and pool our efforts. The networks fueling this trade thrive on communication gaps. We must close them.” The CEO further urged the public to be part of the fight by reporting suspicious activity anonymously through NACADA’s toll-free hotline 1192. “Community support is crucial. Let us protect our youth and safeguard the future,” he said. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origins and intended destination of the intercepted substance as NACADA and its partners ramp up efforts to dismantle the networks behind Kenya’s illicit drug trade."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year.

Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."
Mama Kitchen Garden: Boosting Food Security and Nutrition in Schools and Households,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mama-kitchen-garden-boosting-food-security-and-nutrition-in-schools-and-households/,2025-05-03T08:05:34+03:00,"Africa,Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh","Food security remains one of Africa’s most urgent challenges, with millions facing hunger and inadequate nutrition. In Kenya, nearly 30% of households are food insecure—particularly in arid and semi-arid regions—while malnutrition among children persists at alarming levels. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 18% of children under five are stunted, 10% are underweight, 5% suffer from wasting, and 3% are overweight—painting a grim picture of the nation’s nutritional well-being. In response to this crisis, First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, through her flagship Mama Kitchen Garden initiative—supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development—is championing efforts to enhance food security and improve nutrition at the household and school level. The initiative promotes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, agritech innovation, climate-smart farming, and women’s economic empowerment. It encourages families and learning institutions to embrace kitchen gardens as a sustainable way to access fresh, nutritious food while fostering agricultural education. Speaking during the National Mama Kitchen Garden Private Sector and Development Partners Breakfast Meeting held at the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Headquarters, Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh emphasized the need for a coordinated and inclusive approach to ensure long-term impact. He highlighted the value of school kitchen gardens as “outdoor laboratories,” offering students hands-on learning in soil testing, plant growth, pest control, and sustainable farming. “Experiential learning fosters curiosity, innovation, and paves the way for the next generation of agricultural scientists and environmental stewards,” said Dr. Ronoh. He also noted the initiative’s potential to create mentorship opportunities by connecting students with seasoned farmers and agricultural experts in structured, knowledge-sharing platforms. For urban families and schools with limited space, Dr. Ronoh encouraged the adoption of vertical farming and hydroponics as innovative solutions to boost food production in constrained environments. Elizabeth Koskei, CEO of Mama Doing Good, the organization implementing the initiative jointly with the State Department for Agriculture, said the Mama Kitchen Garden is rooted in the belief that women, families, and communities have the power to transform their lives through self-reliance and nutrition-focused farming. “Our vision is that every household—regardless of income or space—can cultivate a small garden and enjoy the dignity of healthy, homegrown food,” she stated. Key stakeholders present at the event—including KALRO Director General Dr. Eliud Kireger and Kenya Seed Company Managing Director Sammy Chepsiror reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Mama Kitchen Garden and scaling up food security solutions across Kenya. The official launch of the National Mama Kitchen Garden is scheduled for 9th May, 2025, at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) in Koibatek, Baringo County."

Speaking at Athi River Primary School during the Chief’s Climate Action Day, Dr. Omollo emphasized that protecting children from early school leaving, drugs, and exploitation must take precedence in national discourse. “Our children are our greatest resource. We cannot afford to lose them to drugs, crime, or hopelessness. Parents have sacrificed so much to keep them in school. As government, we are committed to ensuring that every child not only attends school but is protected from all forms of exploitation,” he said. He urged national government administrators to work closely with school leadership, parents’ associations, and religious groups to keep children in class and prevent school dropouts, noting that the Ministry will intensify interventions at the local level. Dr. Omollo also condemned the rising cases of drug and substance abuse, especially along highway towns like Athi River, which expose children and youth to illegal activities. He warned traffickers and unscrupulous businesspeople that the government will not allow a generation to be destroyed for profit. At the same event, the PS led a symbolic tree planting exercise under the Chief’s Climate Action Day, a monthly national initiative aimed at achieving President William Ruto’s vision of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He praised Machakos County for being among the best-performing regions despite environmental challenges. “We came here not just to plant trees, but to plant hope and restore dignity. Education and climate action go hand in hand because without a safe, educated generation, we cannot talk about sustainable development,” he noted. Dr. Omollo called on local industries in Machakos to support education and environmental programs, stating that private sector players must invest in the communities they operate in. The event brought together county officials, the leadership of Athi River Primary and Junior Secondary schools, chiefs and assistant chiefs, and representatives from NACADA and NDOC."

The vehicle was found with 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol carefully concealed under cartons of milk in an apparent attempt to deceive law enforcement. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA), led by its CEO Dr. Anthony Omerikwa, speaking at the scene, said. “This was not just an attempt to break the law; it was an intentional move to endanger lives,” Dr. Omerikwa said. “We will not relent in pursuing those involved in the manufacture, trafficking, and sale of illegal or uncustomised substances. Their assets will be traced and seized under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering framework.” Samples of the seized liquid have been dispatched to the Government Chemist for analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest the ethanol was being trafficked for possible use in the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Dr. Omerikwa commended the swift action and coordination by the local police command and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), stating, “This successful operation is a testament to what inter-agency collaboration can achieve. I applaud our partners in the police and KRA for their vigilance and commitment to public safety.” He emphasised the need for enhanced intelligence sharing across government agencies, noting, “More seizures and apprehensions are possible if we break silos and pool our efforts. The networks fueling this trade thrive on communication gaps. We must close them.” The CEO further urged the public to be part of the fight by reporting suspicious activity anonymously through NACADA’s toll-free hotline 1192. “Community support is crucial. Let us protect our youth and safeguard the future,” he said. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origins and intended destination of the intercepted substance as NACADA and its partners ramp up efforts to dismantle the networks behind Kenya’s illicit drug trade."

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."

Wetang’ula lauds elevation of Bungoma District Hospital to Level 6,https://www.kbc.co.ke/wetangula-lauds-elevation-of-bungoma-district-hospital-to-level-6/,2025-05-04T16:47:45+03:00,"Bungoma,Speaker Moses Wetangula","Residents of the Western region are set to benefit from improved access to healthcare following the Cabinet’s decision last week to elevate Bungoma District Hospital to a Level 6 Teaching and Referral Hospital, placing it in the same category as Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi. The elevation of the facility now places it under the National Government, translating to installation of ultramodern equipment, better staffing, and access to specialised care. National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula lauded the move as a game changer. “Our people will no longer have to travel to Eldoret for treatment. Quality healthcare is coming closer to home,” he said. He also urged Kibabii University to seize the opportunity by developing a comprehensive medical program to support the growing health sector in the region. Bungoma Senator David Wakoli echoed the Speaker’s sentiments terming the elevation “a transformative step that will change the lives of our people.” Speaker Wetang’ula also commended government’s recent decision to scrap unofficial fees and discriminatory practices often levelled on those seeking the crucial document. “Every Kenyan deserves an ID, that is a right, not a favour,” Wetang’ula stated. Moving forward, all Form Four students will receive ID cards before exiting school. Wetang’ula also affirmed that the County Government will restructure factory leadership to protect farmers from exploitation. “We will place power back into the hands of those who till the land,” he said. Senator Wakoli supported the call, noting that “coffee farmers have been defrauded by corrupt cooperatives for too long. We must remove these bad actors and help our people reclaim their livelihoods.”"

Nyandarua family appeals for help as 17-year-old son battles cancer,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nyandarua-family-appeals-for-help-as-17-year-old-son-battles-cancer/,2025-05-04T10:48:05+03:00,"Appeal for help,cancer","A family in Mugathika village, Rurii Ward, Olkalou Constituency, Nyandarua County, is grappling with emotional and financial strain after their 17-year-old son, Gidraf Mugo Kamande, was diagnosed with stage 2 brain cancer. What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

"Western MPs defend NG-CDF and NGAAF, say funds fuel local development projects",https://www.kbc.co.ke/western-mps-defend-ng-cdf-and-ngaaf-say-funds-fuel-local-development-projects/,2025-05-03T16:44:40+03:00,"NG-CDF,NGAAF","Leaders from the Western region have reaffirmed their support for the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NGCDF) and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), describing them as lifelines for grassroots development. Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people. They’ve provided bursaries, developed schools, and lifted families. Let us safeguard them,” he said."

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."
Mama Kitchen Garden: Boosting Food Security and Nutrition in Schools and Households,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mama-kitchen-garden-boosting-food-security-and-nutrition-in-schools-and-households/,2025-05-03T08:05:34+03:00,"Africa,Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh","Food security remains one of Africa’s most urgent challenges, with millions facing hunger and inadequate nutrition. In Kenya, nearly 30% of households are food insecure—particularly in arid and semi-arid regions—while malnutrition among children persists at alarming levels. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 18% of children under five are stunted, 10% are underweight, 5% suffer from wasting, and 3% are overweight—painting a grim picture of the nation’s nutritional well-being. In response to this crisis, First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, through her flagship Mama Kitchen Garden initiative—supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development—is championing efforts to enhance food security and improve nutrition at the household and school level. The initiative promotes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, agritech innovation, climate-smart farming, and women’s economic empowerment. It encourages families and learning institutions to embrace kitchen gardens as a sustainable way to access fresh, nutritious food while fostering agricultural education. Speaking during the National Mama Kitchen Garden Private Sector and Development Partners Breakfast Meeting held at the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Headquarters, Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh emphasized the need for a coordinated and inclusive approach to ensure long-term impact. He highlighted the value of school kitchen gardens as “outdoor laboratories,” offering students hands-on learning in soil testing, plant growth, pest control, and sustainable farming. “Experiential learning fosters curiosity, innovation, and paves the way for the next generation of agricultural scientists and environmental stewards,” said Dr. Ronoh. He also noted the initiative’s potential to create mentorship opportunities by connecting students with seasoned farmers and agricultural experts in structured, knowledge-sharing platforms. For urban families and schools with limited space, Dr. Ronoh encouraged the adoption of vertical farming and hydroponics as innovative solutions to boost food production in constrained environments. Elizabeth Koskei, CEO of Mama Doing Good, the organization implementing the initiative jointly with the State Department for Agriculture, said the Mama Kitchen Garden is rooted in the belief that women, families, and communities have the power to transform their lives through self-reliance and nutrition-focused farming. “Our vision is that every household—regardless of income or space—can cultivate a small garden and enjoy the dignity of healthy, homegrown food,” she stated. Key stakeholders present at the event—including KALRO Director General Dr. Eliud Kireger and Kenya Seed Company Managing Director Sammy Chepsiror reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Mama Kitchen Garden and scaling up food security solutions across Kenya. The official launch of the National Mama Kitchen Garden is scheduled for 9th May, 2025, at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) in Koibatek, Baringo County."

Speaking at Athi River Primary School during the Chief’s Climate Action Day, Dr. Omollo emphasized that protecting children from early school leaving, drugs, and exploitation must take precedence in national discourse. “Our children are our greatest resource. We cannot afford to lose them to drugs, crime, or hopelessness. Parents have sacrificed so much to keep them in school. As government, we are committed to ensuring that every child not only attends school but is protected from all forms of exploitation,” he said. He urged national government administrators to work closely with school leadership, parents’ associations, and religious groups to keep children in class and prevent school dropouts, noting that the Ministry will intensify interventions at the local level. Dr. Omollo also condemned the rising cases of drug and substance abuse, especially along highway towns like Athi River, which expose children and youth to illegal activities. He warned traffickers and unscrupulous businesspeople that the government will not allow a generation to be destroyed for profit. At the same event, the PS led a symbolic tree planting exercise under the Chief’s Climate Action Day, a monthly national initiative aimed at achieving President William Ruto’s vision of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He praised Machakos County for being among the best-performing regions despite environmental challenges. “We came here not just to plant trees, but to plant hope and restore dignity. Education and climate action go hand in hand because without a safe, educated generation, we cannot talk about sustainable development,” he noted. Dr. Omollo called on local industries in Machakos to support education and environmental programs, stating that private sector players must invest in the communities they operate in. The event brought together county officials, the leadership of Athi River Primary and Junior Secondary schools, chiefs and assistant chiefs, and representatives from NACADA and NDOC."
"Multi-agency team seize 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol in Webuye",https://www.kbc.co.ke/multi-agency-team-seize-8000-litres-of-illegal-ethanol-in-webuye/,2025-05-02T15:23:58+03:00,"Ethanol,illicit trade","A breakthrough in the fight against illicit substances was achieved on Friday when a lorry transporting what is suspected to be illegal ethanol was intercepted during a joint multi-agency operation. The vehicle was found with 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol carefully concealed under cartons of milk in an apparent attempt to deceive law enforcement. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA), led by its CEO Dr. Anthony Omerikwa, speaking at the scene, said. “This was not just an attempt to break the law; it was an intentional move to endanger lives,” Dr. Omerikwa said. “We will not relent in pursuing those involved in the manufacture, trafficking, and sale of illegal or uncustomised substances. Their assets will be traced and seized under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering framework.” Samples of the seized liquid have been dispatched to the Government Chemist for analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest the ethanol was being trafficked for possible use in the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Dr. Omerikwa commended the swift action and coordination by the local police command and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), stating, “This successful operation is a testament to what inter-agency collaboration can achieve. I applaud our partners in the police and KRA for their vigilance and commitment to public safety.” He emphasised the need for enhanced intelligence sharing across government agencies, noting, “More seizures and apprehensions are possible if we break silos and pool our efforts. The networks fueling this trade thrive on communication gaps. We must close them.” The CEO further urged the public to be part of the fight by reporting suspicious activity anonymously through NACADA’s toll-free hotline 1192. “Community support is crucial. Let us protect our youth and safeguard the future,” he said. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origins and intended destination of the intercepted substance as NACADA and its partners ramp up efforts to dismantle the networks behind Kenya’s illicit drug trade."
