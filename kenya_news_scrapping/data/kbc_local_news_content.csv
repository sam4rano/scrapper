Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area.

"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."

He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025. He inspected the construction progress of the Oria modern market in Uriri."

"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi. Focus is very key since the headline that does not change the unity and development of all Kenyans,” said Mudavadi. “Na nyinyi watu wa mlima mkiteleza, mjue sisi tuko tayari tutachukua. Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated.

He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices.

Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned.

President Ruto pledges to revive Sony Sugar,https://www.kbc.co.ke/president-ruto-pledges-to-revive-sony-sugar/,2025-05-05T23:02:03+03:00,,"President William Ruto has pledged to restore Migori’s sugar Company Sony to profitability as part of the government’s broader efforts to revitalise the sector. The government will adopt a strategy similar to the Mumias Sugar Company recovery plan, the President explained, to modernise Sony Sugar and enhance its efficiency. He said a new management team will be appointed, with a clear mandate to give priority to the interests of cane farmers at the core of the company’s operations. The President was speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, Migori County, which will support livestock farming. He also flagged off the Migori Last Mile Connectivity Project, which will connect 25,000 households to power by December. The programme will cost Ksh1.9 billion. In Rongo, he inspected the construction of Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. President Ruto also launched construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier in Nyatike Constituency, which will reduce fish harvest losses and boost earnings.

The President also inspected the progress of construction works at Oria modern market in Uriri Constituency."
Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025. He inspected the construction progress of the Oria modern market in Uriri."

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

The event brought together key leaders from the Western region, including National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula and Sirisia MP John Walukhe, as the region strategises its political direction ahead of the 2027 general election. Wetang’ula echoed the calls for unity, stating that the that region stands to benefit more by speaking with one voice on matters of national development. “We have been in politics for some time and we know that in politics, however wise you are, without the people you amount to nothing. As a region, we must walk together and speak the same language in development matters as we rally behind President William Ruto,” Wetang’ula stated. On his part, MP Walukhe defended the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), warning against any attempts to abolish it. He argued that the fund continues to support development projects at the grassroots level especially in education and infrastructure."

President Ruto pledges to revive Sony Sugar,https://www.kbc.co.ke/president-ruto-pledges-to-revive-sony-sugar/,2025-05-05T23:02:03+03:00,,"President William Ruto has pledged to restore Migori’s sugar Company Sony to profitability as part of the government’s broader efforts to revitalise the sector. The government will adopt a strategy similar to the Mumias Sugar Company recovery plan, the President explained, to modernise Sony Sugar and enhance its efficiency. He said a new management team will be appointed, with a clear mandate to give priority to the interests of cane farmers at the core of the company’s operations. The President was speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, Migori County, which will support livestock farming. He also flagged off the Migori Last Mile Connectivity Project, which will connect 25,000 households to power by December. The programme will cost Ksh1.9 billion. In Rongo, he inspected the construction of Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School.

The President also inspected the progress of construction works at Oria modern market in Uriri Constituency."
Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025. He inspected the construction progress of the Oria modern market in Uriri."

"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

We are stronger when we walk together,” Mudavadi stated. The event brought together key leaders from the Western region, including National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula and Sirisia MP John Walukhe, as the region strategises its political direction ahead of the 2027 general election. Wetang’ula echoed the calls for unity, stating that the that region stands to benefit more by speaking with one voice on matters of national development. “We have been in politics for some time and we know that in politics, however wise you are, without the people you amount to nothing. As a region, we must walk together and speak the same language in development matters as we rally behind President William Ruto,” Wetang’ula stated.

The government will adopt a strategy similar to the Mumias Sugar Company recovery plan, the President explained, to modernise Sony Sugar and enhance its efficiency.

Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

The event brought together key leaders from the Western region, including National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula and Sirisia MP John Walukhe, as the region strategises its political direction ahead of the 2027 general election. Wetang’ula echoed the calls for unity, stating that the that region stands to benefit more by speaking with one voice on matters of national development. “We have been in politics for some time and we know that in politics, however wise you are, without the people you amount to nothing. As a region, we must walk together and speak the same language in development matters as we rally behind President William Ruto,” Wetang’ula stated.

Speaking during a funeral at Gwassi South Location in Suba South, Homa Bay County, Mbadi urged investigative agencies to move swiftly and apprehend those responsible. The MP was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. “I’m saddened by what happened to my friend and someone we have worked with in Parliament for seven years. I spoke with the President. He is very annoyed and has given stern instructions that the culprits must be brought to book,” Mbadi said. Mbadi singled out Kasipul and Ndhiwa Constituencies as emerging hotspots for political violence in the county. “There is violence taking root in Homa Bay and we must condemn it. It is not worth it. Don’t take the lives of our people because of a political seat. In Ndhiwa Constituency, people are attacking each other with pangas in the name of politicians,” he said. The CS called out politicians allegedly behind the chaos, saying they must be held accountable and expelled from political parties. “To those politicians promoting violence in Homa Bay County, you must stop. You cannot force people to vote you into power or back to power. Please respect people’s choices, be democratic and persuade people to vote for you,” urged Mbadi. “We will announce publicly that such politicians should not be associated with parties we support. I cannot support a party where a leader in that party is behaving like a hooligan,” he added."

The President explained that the country’s economy has stabilised and cited the decline of inflation from 9.6 per cent in 2022 to 3.5 per cent now and increased production of maize, tea and sugarcane, and better prices of coffee and milk. He made the remarks at State House Nairobi, on Friday, when he met Maa community elders and leaders from 10 counties. Governors Joseph ole Lenku of Kajiado, Patrick ole Ntutu (Narok) and Jonathan Lelelit (Samburu), and 25 MPs were present. The President pointed out that the policies his administration has undertaken have led to the improvement of the economy. “I can proudly say the people of Kenya, through the decisions we have made collectively, are reaping the fruits because the economy is now stable, ” he pointed out. He urged the elders to ensure that parents take children to school without discrimination over gender. “Education is critical and the Maa community should not be left behind. You should take all children to school, boys and girls, without discrimination,” President Ruto said. He also asked leaders to discourage divisive politics and embrace unity for the sake of peace and cohesion. “As Kenyans, we should unite and discourage politics based on tribalism if we have to address challenges facing our people collectively, ” said President Ruto.

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."

Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen.

Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed. Tunataka kujua nani amekua nyuma yake, motive ni nini na kwanini amefanya njama ya kuua kiongozi wetu.” So far, police have arrested one suspect linked to the murder and recovered a getaway vehicle used during the incident."
Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

Speaking during a funeral at Gwassi South Location in Suba South, Homa Bay County, Mbadi urged investigative agencies to move swiftly and apprehend those responsible. The MP was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. “I’m saddened by what happened to my friend and someone we have worked with in Parliament for seven years. I spoke with the President. He is very annoyed and has given stern instructions that the culprits must be brought to book,” Mbadi said. Mbadi singled out Kasipul and Ndhiwa Constituencies as emerging hotspots for political violence in the county. “There is violence taking root in Homa Bay and we must condemn it. It is not worth it. Don’t take the lives of our people because of a political seat. In Ndhiwa Constituency, people are attacking each other with pangas in the name of politicians,” he said. The CS called out politicians allegedly behind the chaos, saying they must be held accountable and expelled from political parties. “To those politicians promoting violence in Homa Bay County, you must stop.

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025. He inspected the construction progress of the Oria modern market in Uriri."

"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking.

He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

Autopsy on slain Kasipul MP set for May 5th,https://www.kbc.co.ke/autopsy-on-slain-kasipul-mp-set-for-may-5th/,2025-05-02T16:11:01+03:00,"DCI,Kasipul MP Charles Ong'ondo Were","An autopsy on the body of the late Kasipul Member of Parliament Charles Ong’ondo Were will be conducted on Monday, May 5th, 2025. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the exercise will be led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor. “An autopsy led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor is scheduled for Monday, May 5, 2025, to provide further insights into the cause of death and support the investigation,” the DCI said Friday through a statement. The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned.

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."
Kenya marks World Press Freedom Day amid urgent calls to safeguard media freedom,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-marks-world-press-freedom-day-amid-urgent-calls-to-safeguard-media-freedom/,2025-05-02T17:05:21+03:00,World Press Freedom Day,"Kenya has joined the globe in commemorating the World Press Freedom Day, with calls for urgent reforms to protect media freedom amid rising threats and challenges linked to Artificial Intelligence. Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Addressing Kenyan professionals, community leaders and industry pioneers during a fireside chat on Thursday evening in Doha, Qatar, PS Njogu underscored the civic and patriotic responsibility of the diaspora to safeguard Kenya’s reputation and counter negative publicity. She highlighted the significant impact of the diaspora in championing Kenya’s interests internationally, urging attendees to actively mention Kenya when discussing investment opportunities, tourism, ICT, skilled workforce, and other key topics in influential spaces and decision-making forums. Accompanied by Ambassador Mohamed Nur Adan, Kenya’s envoy to Qatar, PS Njogu also stressed the importance of knowledge and skills transfer from the diaspora to drive Kenya’s socio-economic progress.

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand. Discipline, commitment, and clarity of purpose are key.” Dr. Oluga reminded the staff that meaningful change often comes from simple, consistent actions. “Real transformation isn’t always about complex solutions.

"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."

During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi. Focus is very key since the headline that does not change the unity and development of all Kenyans,” said Mudavadi. “Na nyinyi watu wa mlima mkiteleza, mjue sisi tuko tayari tutachukua. Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana.

In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."
Kenya marks World Press Freedom Day amid urgent calls to safeguard media freedom,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-marks-world-press-freedom-day-amid-urgent-calls-to-safeguard-media-freedom/,2025-05-02T17:05:21+03:00,World Press Freedom Day,"Kenya has joined the globe in commemorating the World Press Freedom Day, with calls for urgent reforms to protect media freedom amid rising threats and challenges linked to Artificial Intelligence. Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Addressing Kenyan professionals, community leaders and industry pioneers during a fireside chat on Thursday evening in Doha, Qatar, PS Njogu underscored the civic and patriotic responsibility of the diaspora to safeguard Kenya’s reputation and counter negative publicity. She highlighted the significant impact of the diaspora in championing Kenya’s interests internationally, urging attendees to actively mention Kenya when discussing investment opportunities, tourism, ICT, skilled workforce, and other key topics in influential spaces and decision-making forums. Accompanied by Ambassador Mohamed Nur Adan, Kenya’s envoy to Qatar, PS Njogu also stressed the importance of knowledge and skills transfer from the diaspora to drive Kenya’s socio-economic progress.

She encouraged the community to collectively adopt a forest, contributing to increased tree and forest cover. PS Njogu also urged the diaspora to take advantage of government initiatives such as DhowCSD, which offers opportunities to invest in government securities, and to explore prospects in health, tourism, ICT, manufacturing, sports, and agriculture to expand their investment portfolios.

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand.

"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."
"Finance Bill 2025 will bring great benefits to Kenyans, says President Ruto",https://www.kbc.co.ke/finance-bill-2025-will-bring-great-benefits-to-kenyans-says-president-ruto/,2025-05-01T17:31:26+03:00,,"President William Ruto announced on Thursday that the proposed Finance Bill 2025 will offer significant benefits to Kenyans. He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."

Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated.

He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success.

"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."

Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

He made the remarks at State House Nairobi, on Friday, when he met Maa community elders and leaders from 10 counties. Governors Joseph ole Lenku of Kajiado, Patrick ole Ntutu (Narok) and Jonathan Lelelit (Samburu), and 25 MPs were present. The President pointed out that the policies his administration has undertaken have led to the improvement of the economy. “I can proudly say the people of Kenya, through the decisions we have made collectively, are reaping the fruits because the economy is now stable, ” he pointed out. He urged the elders to ensure that parents take children to school without discrimination over gender. “Education is critical and the Maa community should not be left behind.

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

Autopsy on slain Kasipul MP set for May 5th,https://www.kbc.co.ke/autopsy-on-slain-kasipul-mp-set-for-may-5th/,2025-05-02T16:11:01+03:00,"DCI,Kasipul MP Charles Ong'ondo Were","An autopsy on the body of the late Kasipul Member of Parliament Charles Ong’ondo Were will be conducted on Monday, May 5th, 2025. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the exercise will be led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor. “An autopsy led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor is scheduled for Monday, May 5, 2025, to provide further insights into the cause of death and support the investigation,” the DCI said Friday through a statement. The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."
Kenya marks World Press Freedom Day amid urgent calls to safeguard media freedom,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-marks-world-press-freedom-day-amid-urgent-calls-to-safeguard-media-freedom/,2025-05-02T17:05:21+03:00,World Press Freedom Day,"Kenya has joined the globe in commemorating the World Press Freedom Day, with calls for urgent reforms to protect media freedom amid rising threats and challenges linked to Artificial Intelligence. Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Addressing Kenyan professionals, community leaders and industry pioneers during a fireside chat on Thursday evening in Doha, Qatar, PS Njogu underscored the civic and patriotic responsibility of the diaspora to safeguard Kenya’s reputation and counter negative publicity. She highlighted the significant impact of the diaspora in championing Kenya’s interests internationally, urging attendees to actively mention Kenya when discussing investment opportunities, tourism, ICT, skilled workforce, and other key topics in influential spaces and decision-making forums. Accompanied by Ambassador Mohamed Nur Adan, Kenya’s envoy to Qatar, PS Njogu also stressed the importance of knowledge and skills transfer from the diaspora to drive Kenya’s socio-economic progress. She noted that leveraging international expertise acquired abroad is essential for advancing national development. On environmental stewardship, PS Njogu called on the more than 70,000 Kenyans in Qatar to support Kenya’s ambitious goal of growing 15 billion trees by 2032. She encouraged the community to collectively adopt a forest, contributing to increased tree and forest cover. PS Njogu also urged the diaspora to take advantage of government initiatives such as DhowCSD, which offers opportunities to invest in government securities, and to explore prospects in health, tourism, ICT, manufacturing, sports, and agriculture to expand their investment portfolios. The PS also used the session to update Kenyans in Doha of Government programmes back home under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda(BETA) and the importance to the citizenry. The session concluded with an interactive discussion, allowing Kenyans present to engage directly with officials and explore ways to further contribute to Kenya’s growth and global standing."

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand. Discipline, commitment, and clarity of purpose are key.” Dr. Oluga reminded the staff that meaningful change often comes from simple, consistent actions. “Real transformation isn’t always about complex solutions. Sometimes, it’s the simple things we do consistently that create the greatest impact. We need big, straightforward ideas that will have a ripple effect across the system.”"
"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."

He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

In the meantime, he says plans are underway to recruit 20,000 additional teachers to improve the teacher-to-student ratio.

Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised.

According to a statement by the police, the incident occurred at 7:30 p.m. near the City Mortuary roundabout along Ngong Road where a white Toyota Crown vehicle, reportedly carrying the MP and two others, had stopped at a red traffic light when a motorcycle with two occupants pulled up beside it. “According to reports confirmed by the Nairobi Regional Police Commander, at around 7:30 pm this evening, a white Toyota Crown vehicle came to a stop at a red traffic light on Ngong Road, near the City Mortuary roundabout.” Read the statement. Eyewitnesses say the pillion passenger dismounted and approached the car before opening fire on the passenger side, where Were was seated. The gunman then quickly fled the scene on the motorcycle, which sped off before any intervention could occur. “Eyewitnesses have indicated that a motorcycle carrying a rider and a pillion passenger stopped alongside the car. The pillion passenger approached the vehicle and fired shots at the passenger side before jumping back onto the motorcycle and speeding away.” Read the statement. The vehicle’s driver and another passenger, who were both unharmed in the attack, rushed the injured MP to Nairobi Hospital, but medical personnel pronounced him dead on arrival. Nairobi Regional Police Commander confirmed the identity of the deceased as Charles Were, MP for Kasipul. “The nature of this crime appears to be both targeted and premeditated,” the statement from the National Police Service read.

The government will adopt a strategy similar to the Mumias Sugar Company recovery plan, the President explained, to modernise Sony Sugar and enhance its efficiency.

Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

The MP was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. “I’m saddened by what happened to my friend and someone we have worked with in Parliament for seven years.

Mbadi singled out Kasipul and Ndhiwa Constituencies as emerging hotspots for political violence in the county. “There is violence taking root in Homa Bay and we must condemn it. It is not worth it. Don’t take the lives of our people because of a political seat. In Ndhiwa Constituency, people are attacking each other with pangas in the name of politicians,” he said. The CS called out politicians allegedly behind the chaos, saying they must be held accountable and expelled from political parties. “To those politicians promoting violence in Homa Bay County, you must stop.

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act.

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic.

Discipline, commitment, and clarity of purpose are key.” Dr. Oluga reminded the staff that meaningful change often comes from simple, consistent actions. “Real transformation isn’t always about complex solutions.

Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."

To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"
Ruto fulfills pledge to educate vulnerable Nairobi girls,https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-fulfills-pledge-to-educate-vulnerable-nairobi-girls/,2025-05-01T14:57:41+03:00,"Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi,PCEA Booth Girls’ High School","President William Ruto has fulfilled a promise he made earlier this year to support the education of vulnerable girls from Nairobi County. The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

Ruto says the proposal contained in the finance bill before the national assembly seeks to ensure Kenyan workers retire in dignity. Further, he said the finance bill contains proposals that he says will stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency and enhance competitiveness, even as he hailed government policies for enhancing the saving culture. In the meantime, he says plans are underway to recruit 20,000 additional teachers to improve the teacher-to-student ratio. He further dismissed assertions that in his recent trip to China, he was seeking a loan saying the deal inked will see the expansion of the SGR railway without a cost to the exchequer."
Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised. The submission comes at a time of growing global climate anxiety and provides a rare beacon of leadership from the Global South. Kenya’s call to the international community is clear: back bold action with real support. “With this submission, Kenya invites the world to partner in unlocking sustainable development opportunities that will shape a greener, more inclusive future for all,” Dr. Barasa added."

Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned.

Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi. Focus is very key since the headline that does not change the unity and development of all Kenyans,” said Mudavadi. “Na nyinyi watu wa mlima mkiteleza, mjue sisi tuko tayari tutachukua. Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

In a statement issued Sunday, National Police Service (NPS) Spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga said the arrests followed a swift operation based on previously gathered leads, which placed the suspects at the crime scene. “Officers from the National Police Service swiftly conducted an operation and successfully arrested four suspects who had been positively placed at the crime scene,” Nyaga said. Police have also recovered crucial evidence believed to be linked to the crime, as well as the perpetrators. The NPS further stated that investigators have identified ties between some of the arrested individuals and the ‘Mjahidin’ gang, which is suspected of involvement in a series of armed robberies in Nairobi’s Eastlands area. “NPS investigators and the technical team are working tirelessly, leveraging their expertise, to establish the motive behind the fatal shooting and to bring all those involved to justice,” said Nyaga. He urged the public to remain calm and avoid speculation, warning that commentary by individuals not directly involved in the case could compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation. “Moreover, the NPS advises individuals not directly involved in this investigation to refrain from making comments that could hinder ongoing efforts,” Nyaga stated.

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana.

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Addressing Kenyan professionals, community leaders and industry pioneers during a fireside chat on Thursday evening in Doha, Qatar, PS Njogu underscored the civic and patriotic responsibility of the diaspora to safeguard Kenya’s reputation and counter negative publicity. She highlighted the significant impact of the diaspora in championing Kenya’s interests internationally, urging attendees to actively mention Kenya when discussing investment opportunities, tourism, ICT, skilled workforce, and other key topics in influential spaces and decision-making forums. Accompanied by Ambassador Mohamed Nur Adan, Kenya’s envoy to Qatar, PS Njogu also stressed the importance of knowledge and skills transfer from the diaspora to drive Kenya’s socio-economic progress.

On environmental stewardship, PS Njogu called on the more than 70,000 Kenyans in Qatar to support Kenya’s ambitious goal of growing 15 billion trees by 2032. She encouraged the community to collectively adopt a forest, contributing to increased tree and forest cover. PS Njogu also urged the diaspora to take advantage of government initiatives such as DhowCSD, which offers opportunities to invest in government securities, and to explore prospects in health, tourism, ICT, manufacturing, sports, and agriculture to expand their investment portfolios.

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic.

"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."
"Finance Bill 2025 will bring great benefits to Kenyans, says President Ruto",https://www.kbc.co.ke/finance-bill-2025-will-bring-great-benefits-to-kenyans-says-president-ruto/,2025-05-01T17:31:26+03:00,,"President William Ruto announced on Thursday that the proposed Finance Bill 2025 will offer significant benefits to Kenyans. He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

In the meantime, he says plans are underway to recruit 20,000 additional teachers to improve the teacher-to-student ratio.

Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised. The submission comes at a time of growing global climate anxiety and provides a rare beacon of leadership from the Global South. Kenya’s call to the international community is clear: back bold action with real support. “With this submission, Kenya invites the world to partner in unlocking sustainable development opportunities that will shape a greener, more inclusive future for all,” Dr. Barasa added."

He underscored his mission to implement lasting changes for the nation’s development. Speaking in Karen, Nairobi, during the installation of Dr Benard Chitunga as the Chancellor of The Co-operative University of Kenya, Ruto reiterated that having been granted the mandate to lead the country, he has a responsibility to bring about change. He assured Kenyans that he will deliver, despite prevailing skepticism. “Many people may not believe what I am saying, but you will be shocked. I am going to confound the naysayers,” he stated. According to the head of state, leadership requires making the right decisions, even if they are not immediately popular. He cited the changes his administration implemented regarding the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). “I undertook to the people of Kenya that I was going to change the savings culture. You all remember that everyone used to pay NSSF Ksh 200 until 2023, and that was okay. Explain to me why Ksh 200 is okay. How is Ksh 200 going to amount to savings?” he posed Ruto defended the decision to increase the amount contributed by Kenyans to the NSSF, asserting that it is already yielding positive results. “We made the right decision. Today, every Kenyan is saving 6% of their salary, and every employer is saving 6% on behalf of their employees. We have some statistics. From independence up to 2023, we saved Ksh 320 billion. That’s in 60 years. However, in just two years, from 2023 to the present, we have saved Ksh 280 billion,” he said. “Uganda has a bigger social security fund than Kenya although they have a quarter of our economy. Tanzania has a bigger national social security fund, even though they have 50% of our economy. Why? Because they made the right decisions about savings,” Ruto explained, providing a comparative analysis of the situation in Kenya and its neighbours. “In Uganda, everybody saves 10% of their salary, and in Tanzania, everybody saves 8% of their salary. But in Kenya, we were saving Ksh 200, and that was supposed to be okay and I was supposed to do nothing about it,” he added. By the end of this year, the president stated that the country will have doubled the amount saved through the NSSF over the past 60 years, and by 2027, a trillion shillings will have been saved “because we have made some bold decisions.”"

Mudavadi, who also serves as the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, informed the Senate Standing Committee on National Security, Defence, and Foreign Relations that the overarching strategy is to shift the policy from the confines of the ministry and make it citizen-centred. He stated that anchoring the policy in law with parliamentary input will place Kenya’s interests at the forefront in an ever-changing global environment. “We want our international and diplomatic engagements to help improve the livelihoods and welfare of every Kenyan as we protect the interests of our country which come first.” said Mudavadi. He further explained to the committee, which sought statements about shaping Kenya’s global image, that the swift changes in the global environment necessitated a review of the policy with a focus on pragmatism, foresight, and long-term perspective. “What we are curing is the traditional way of doing things under hidden cameras, we need to be transparent and forthright in our engagements and be accountable to the citizens in our foreign engagements.” said Mudavadi. “Once we actualize the sessional paper, we will adopt a number of reforms including making public treaties and agreements signed with other countries, once approved by parliamentary. This will help the public to understand areas where they feel they can engage and invest abroad among other benefits,” Mudavadi explained. He also informed the committee that transparency in the issuance of scholarships would be a key aspect of the sessional paper, aiming to eliminate the inequality and unfairness seen in the past. Mudavadi stressed that all Kenyans should have equitable access to opportunities that benefit the country, including those available in the education sector abroad. “Every part of Kenya must get an equal opportunity when it comes to sharing of such opportunities like scholarships. Even if we later decide to bond the students in giving back to the nation once they have graduated, this must be done with fairness and transparency. Scholarships are not a military secret. The sessional paper will outline how the beneficiaries will be identified and the criteria will be known for Kenyans to appreciate that indeed there was transparency.” Mudavadi detailed. “We are also looking at how to deal with the unscrupulous travel agents and agencies that lure Kenyans and dupe innocent citizens when it comes to securing job opportunities abroad. We want to put measures that the Ministry will use to sensitize the citizens so that they are not swindled and left high and dry.” added the Prime CS. Mudavadi, in response to a question about protecting Kenyans seeking jobs abroad, stated that Parliament should assist the Ministry in strengthening laws to prosecute rogue agencies. He also emphasised the need to sensitise and caution Kenyans about regions that are no-go zones, where they may face the risk of human trafficking or slavery. “Our engagements with parliament or even other institution is to help save lives. This is a campaign that should be wholesome. The awareness should not be left for the ministry or government, since when Kenyans suffer abroad it pains many back homes.” said Mudavadi. “As a ministry we are also cautioning Kenyans that once you are wheels-up, the moment you land on the soils of the other country, the laws that govern your stay once the plane has landed are the laws of the foreign country.” said Mudavadi as he urged Parliament to help in enacting laws that will help the ministry navigate legal processes for Kenyans incarcerated abroad. “When you get involved in a traffic offense abroad or you are caught in a brawl in a night club then you want the case to be a Kenyan problem, and yet we don’t have monetary provisions to help in dealing with such cases, you are putting us in a tight corner. Especially to our young people who still want to adventure, they need to be cautious of the same.” Mudavadi reiterated He also informed the committee that the sessional paper aims to embed the foreign affairs portfolio within the National Security Council framework, addressing matters related to budgetary allocations and giving the Ministry greater capacity for engagement. Additionally, Mudavadi shared that Kenya is seeking ways to broaden its asset base in its missions abroad. A component of the sessional paper addresses diplomatic appointments, advocating that career diplomats should receive at least 70% of such appointments, with other experienced officers integrated at a minimum of 30%. “Once entrenched in the policy will clear the ambiguity and guide future nominations and appointments.” he stated. “We are facing fiscal difficulties and some of our missions are grappling with financial constraints but we are working on making sure that our diplomatic missions and the diplomats are not underfunded for this can also be very dangerous.” he added. The committee was chaired by Isiolo County Senator Fatuma Dullo."
From costly treatments to dietary changes: A journalist’s battle with rare condition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/your-condition-doesnt-define-you-it-refines-you/,2025-04-30T10:40:36+03:00,"Alvin Kaunda,AOSD","Alvin Kaunda, a budding journalist, had just landed his dream job at the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). He shot to fame when a baby elephant interrupted his piece-to-camera at an animal orphanage, a hilarious moment that quickly went viral. The clip was picked up by major international news outlets, catapulting him into the limelight and inspiring him to fully pursue his passion for wildlife journalism. “I enjoyed every bit of telling such stories. It was both fulfilling and rewarding,” says the young journalist. However, in June 2024, what initially seemed like normal fatigue from the demands of his work took a worrying turn when he developed a fever, body rash, and joint pain. What followed was chronic pain, prompting Alvin, who was living alone at the time, to travel home to Mombasa for further medical evaluation. During this period, his condition worsened, leading to hospitalisation as the mysterious illness gradually affected his mobility. During a second visit to a different hospital, he was diagnosed with sepsis, a serious medical condition where the body’s response to an infection triggers widespread inflammation, potentially resulting in tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) Although the diagnosis was devastating, Alvin felt a sense of relief that doctors had finally identified his illness and believed it could be treated. However, despite the initial prognosis, his condition failed to improve, leaving doctors puzzled once again. By then, Alvin had undergone over 20 medical tests in a desperate attempt to save his life. Eventually, he was discharged to manage his symptoms at home. During this time, his dreams, career, and love for wildlife expeditions began to fade; his only desire was to get well again. It was during one of his many outpatient visits that Alvin experienced a sudden attack. This was a turning point, as doctors witnessed the episode firsthand and ordered a ferritin test, a blood protein that contains iron and indicates how much iron the body stores. The test results revealed that Alvin had Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), a rare systemic autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks itself instead of providing protection. The disease is uncommon, affecting only about 1 in 100,000 people. Diet Changes Now, ten months later, Alvin, who relies on expensive treatments that include medication and regular testing to manage his overactive immune system, has been forced to make significant lifestyle changes, including a complete overhaul of his diet. “I’m still learning about the condition. There’s no cure for Still’s disease, but it can go into remission, and there is no time frame for this,” he told KBC Digital. “As a bachelor, I used to prefer fast food because it was convenient, but that had to change.” “Junk and processed foods are triggers for flare-ups, so I now stick to fresh ingredients and prepare my own meals, something I never imagined I’d do,” says the journalist, who lost his father to cancer just a month ago. “This condition has been a real eye-opener. The truth is, there are countless benefits to healthy eating. You don’t have to wait until you’re sick to make a change.” “I watched my dad change his diet tremendously after being diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. Since 2019, his eating habits were completely different, and he fought the disease bravely until March 9th, 2025, when he passed away at the age of 57,” he explains. “Living with AOSD, a non-curable condition, has completely changed my relationship with food. My diet is now part of my treatment. It helps me manage flare-ups, inflammation, and energy levels. To my peers: don’t underestimate the power of what you put on your plate. It can truly be medicine,” he continues. Alvin, who at the time of publication was experiencing an episode, further shared insights into managing the condition while reflecting on the financial burden, which he admits ‘feels heavier than the illness itself.’ “My condition requires lifelong management with medications like methotrexate, a type of DMARD (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug), regular blood tests, doctor consultations, and at times, emergency care during flare-ups. These treatments aren’t optional; they are necessary to keep me going and to manage my pain, inflammation, fatigue, and the risks that come with a suppressed immune system. But it comes at a cost. Every hospital visit, every blood test, and every prescription add up. And because AOSD is a rare autoimmune disease, not all treatments are covered or even easily available,” he points out. He adds, “I’m sharing this just to highlight what so many people with chronic and rare diseases face. We fight not only our symptoms but also a system that often overlooks the financial burden of being unwell. Healthcare shouldn’t be a privilege; it should be a right. And rare conditions like AOSD deserve more awareness, better support, and more affordable treatment options.” Although Alvin may have slowed down on his wildlife expeditions, his perspective on life has changed, and he believes every day is a gift to continue raising awareness of Still’s disease and to participate in advocacy efforts primarily focused on NCDs. “I live more intentionally now. Every good day is a gift. My condition has taught me not to take health for granted and to prioritise balance, joy, and rest. Life may not go back to what it was before diagnosis—but it can still be full, meaningful, and impactful,” he says. Warning Labels While many factors can increase the risk of developing an autoimmune condition, nutrition may also influence the risk and severity of these diseases. Concerns are growing over the rising prevalence of diet-related diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, among children and young people—conditions that were previously associated only with older adults. In light of this situation, various stakeholders, including the church (NCCK), are advocating for the promotion of healthy eating habits through policy interventions, such as implementing Front-of-Pack Warning Labels (FOPWL) on food products. This initiative aims to empower consumers to make more informed choices about their purchases. “If Kenya were to adopt black octagonal warning labels on foods with high levels of nutrients linked to NCDs, it would be a step in the right direction to reduce the excessive consumption of junk food, which poses significant health risks,” notes Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist and programme officer at IILA. Their advocacy efforts are yielding results; Kenya, through the Ministry of Health, is set to launch its first Nutrition Profile Model next month. This key document will lay the groundwork for developing regulations that require food manufacturers to display clear warning labels on the front of food packaging, informing consumers about high levels of unhealthy nutrients such as sugar, sodium, saturated fats, and trans fats. Additionally, regulations aimed at countering aggressive commercial marketing that targets NCD risk factors in children and young people will also be considered. Alvin is among those who welcome this significant milestone, hopeful that one day the government will enact food policies and regulations that will save lives. “To the food and beverage industry, I personally feel that they have a massive role to play in public health. As someone living with a non-curable disease, I rely on food not just for nutrition, but for survival. The upcoming nutrient profile model is an opportunity to raise the standard. Create products that nourish, not harm. Label them clearly. Remove harmful additives,” he appeals. He presents another challenge to all: “We should move from marketing what is addictive to producing what is actually healing. Consumers deserve transparency, and those of us living with lifelong conditions deserve better choices. To policymakers: support access to affordable, nutritious food; it’s a basic right. And to others fighting incurable diseases—focus on what you can control, and let food be one of your tools for healing and strength.” He signs off with a heartfelt message of encouragement to everyone navigating life with a chronic illness. ” Your condition doesn’t define you; it refines you. Take it one step at a time. There will be tough days, but you’re not alone. Your strength lies in showing up, even when it’s hard. Find a routine that works for you, and don’t be afraid to advocate for your needs.” WATCH THE VIDEO"

President Ruto pledges to revive Sony Sugar,https://www.kbc.co.ke/president-ruto-pledges-to-revive-sony-sugar/,2025-05-05T23:02:03+03:00,,"President William Ruto has pledged to restore Migori’s sugar Company Sony to profitability as part of the government’s broader efforts to revitalise the sector. The government will adopt a strategy similar to the Mumias Sugar Company recovery plan, the President explained, to modernise Sony Sugar and enhance its efficiency. He said a new management team will be appointed, with a clear mandate to give priority to the interests of cane farmers at the core of the company’s operations. The President was speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, Migori County, which will support livestock farming. He also flagged off the Migori Last Mile Connectivity Project, which will connect 25,000 households to power by December. The programme will cost Ksh1.9 billion. In Rongo, he inspected the construction of Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. President Ruto also launched construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier in Nyatike Constituency, which will reduce fish harvest losses and boost earnings. He said the government is harnessing Lake Victoria’s huge potential, including fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and transportation, to spur growth, create jobs and reduce poverty. The President also inspected the progress of construction works at Oria modern market in Uriri Constituency."
Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025. He inspected the construction progress of the Oria modern market in Uriri."

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."
"Ruto says Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact meant to unite country, spur development",https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-says-kenya-kwanza-odm-pact-meant-to-unite-country-spur-development/,2025-05-04T18:48:09+03:00,"Kenya Kwanza-ODM pact,President Wiliam Ruto","The agreement between Kenya Kwanza and the Orange Democratic Movement to work together is aimed at making it easier to implement a transformative development agenda, President William Ruto has said. The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

"We’ll not take it lying down, ODM leaders demand probe into MP Were’s killing",https://www.kbc.co.ke/well-not-take-it-lying-down-odm-leaders-demand-probe-into-mp-weres-killing/,2025-05-04T14:20:50+03:00,"Gladys Wanga,MP Charles Were","ODM leaders have demanded a thorough and transparent investigation into the killing of Kasipul MP Charles Ong’ondo Were, who was gunned down by unknown assailants on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed. Tunataka kujua nani amekua nyuma yake, motive ni nini na kwanini amefanya njama ya kuua kiongozi wetu.” So far, police have arrested one suspect linked to the murder and recovered a getaway vehicle used during the incident."
Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand. Discipline, commitment, and clarity of purpose are key.” Dr. Oluga reminded the staff that meaningful change often comes from simple, consistent actions. “Real transformation isn’t always about complex solutions. Sometimes, it’s the simple things we do consistently that create the greatest impact. We need big, straightforward ideas that will have a ripple effect across the system.”"
"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."
"Finance Bill 2025 will bring great benefits to Kenyans, says President Ruto",https://www.kbc.co.ke/finance-bill-2025-will-bring-great-benefits-to-kenyans-says-president-ruto/,2025-05-01T17:31:26+03:00,,"President William Ruto announced on Thursday that the proposed Finance Bill 2025 will offer significant benefits to Kenyans. He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

Ruto says the proposal contained in the finance bill before the national assembly seeks to ensure Kenyan workers retire in dignity. Further, he said the finance bill contains proposals that he says will stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency and enhance competitiveness, even as he hailed government policies for enhancing the saving culture. In the meantime, he says plans are underway to recruit 20,000 additional teachers to improve the teacher-to-student ratio.

Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised. The submission comes at a time of growing global climate anxiety and provides a rare beacon of leadership from the Global South. Kenya’s call to the international community is clear: back bold action with real support. “With this submission, Kenya invites the world to partner in unlocking sustainable development opportunities that will shape a greener, more inclusive future for all,” Dr. Barasa added."

He underscored his mission to implement lasting changes for the nation’s development. Speaking in Karen, Nairobi, during the installation of Dr Benard Chitunga as the Chancellor of The Co-operative University of Kenya, Ruto reiterated that having been granted the mandate to lead the country, he has a responsibility to bring about change. He assured Kenyans that he will deliver, despite prevailing skepticism. “Many people may not believe what I am saying, but you will be shocked. I am going to confound the naysayers,” he stated. According to the head of state, leadership requires making the right decisions, even if they are not immediately popular. He cited the changes his administration implemented regarding the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). “I undertook to the people of Kenya that I was going to change the savings culture. You all remember that everyone used to pay NSSF Ksh 200 until 2023, and that was okay. Explain to me why Ksh 200 is okay. How is Ksh 200 going to amount to savings?” he posed Ruto defended the decision to increase the amount contributed by Kenyans to the NSSF, asserting that it is already yielding positive results. “We made the right decision. Today, every Kenyan is saving 6% of their salary, and every employer is saving 6% on behalf of their employees. We have some statistics. From independence up to 2023, we saved Ksh 320 billion. That’s in 60 years. However, in just two years, from 2023 to the present, we have saved Ksh 280 billion,” he said. “Uganda has a bigger social security fund than Kenya although they have a quarter of our economy. Tanzania has a bigger national social security fund, even though they have 50% of our economy. Why? Because they made the right decisions about savings,” Ruto explained, providing a comparative analysis of the situation in Kenya and its neighbours. “In Uganda, everybody saves 10% of their salary, and in Tanzania, everybody saves 8% of their salary. But in Kenya, we were saving Ksh 200, and that was supposed to be okay and I was supposed to do nothing about it,” he added. By the end of this year, the president stated that the country will have doubled the amount saved through the NSSF over the past 60 years, and by 2027, a trillion shillings will have been saved “because we have made some bold decisions.”"
"Revised foreign policy to reposition Kenya’s international strategy, says Mudavadi",https://www.kbc.co.ke/revised-foreign-policy-to-reposition-kenyas-international-strategy-says-mudavadi/,2025-04-30T13:32:05+03:00,,"Kenya’s revised foreign policy aims to prioritize the interests of its citizens and reposition the country’s foreign engagements within the dynamic global landscape, according to Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. Mudavadi, who also serves as the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, informed the Senate Standing Committee on National Security, Defence, and Foreign Relations that the overarching strategy is to shift the policy from the confines of the ministry and make it citizen-centred. He stated that anchoring the policy in law with parliamentary input will place Kenya’s interests at the forefront in an ever-changing global environment. “We want our international and diplomatic engagements to help improve the livelihoods and welfare of every Kenyan as we protect the interests of our country which come first.” said Mudavadi. He further explained to the committee, which sought statements about shaping Kenya’s global image, that the swift changes in the global environment necessitated a review of the policy with a focus on pragmatism, foresight, and long-term perspective. “What we are curing is the traditional way of doing things under hidden cameras, we need to be transparent and forthright in our engagements and be accountable to the citizens in our foreign engagements.” said Mudavadi. “Once we actualize the sessional paper, we will adopt a number of reforms including making public treaties and agreements signed with other countries, once approved by parliamentary. This will help the public to understand areas where they feel they can engage and invest abroad among other benefits,” Mudavadi explained. He also informed the committee that transparency in the issuance of scholarships would be a key aspect of the sessional paper, aiming to eliminate the inequality and unfairness seen in the past. Mudavadi stressed that all Kenyans should have equitable access to opportunities that benefit the country, including those available in the education sector abroad. “Every part of Kenya must get an equal opportunity when it comes to sharing of such opportunities like scholarships. Even if we later decide to bond the students in giving back to the nation once they have graduated, this must be done with fairness and transparency. Scholarships are not a military secret. The sessional paper will outline how the beneficiaries will be identified and the criteria will be known for Kenyans to appreciate that indeed there was transparency.” Mudavadi detailed. “We are also looking at how to deal with the unscrupulous travel agents and agencies that lure Kenyans and dupe innocent citizens when it comes to securing job opportunities abroad. We want to put measures that the Ministry will use to sensitize the citizens so that they are not swindled and left high and dry.” added the Prime CS. Mudavadi, in response to a question about protecting Kenyans seeking jobs abroad, stated that Parliament should assist the Ministry in strengthening laws to prosecute rogue agencies. He also emphasised the need to sensitise and caution Kenyans about regions that are no-go zones, where they may face the risk of human trafficking or slavery. “Our engagements with parliament or even other institution is to help save lives. This is a campaign that should be wholesome. The awareness should not be left for the ministry or government, since when Kenyans suffer abroad it pains many back homes.” said Mudavadi. “As a ministry we are also cautioning Kenyans that once you are wheels-up, the moment you land on the soils of the other country, the laws that govern your stay once the plane has landed are the laws of the foreign country.” said Mudavadi as he urged Parliament to help in enacting laws that will help the ministry navigate legal processes for Kenyans incarcerated abroad. “When you get involved in a traffic offense abroad or you are caught in a brawl in a night club then you want the case to be a Kenyan problem, and yet we don’t have monetary provisions to help in dealing with such cases, you are putting us in a tight corner. Especially to our young people who still want to adventure, they need to be cautious of the same.” Mudavadi reiterated He also informed the committee that the sessional paper aims to embed the foreign affairs portfolio within the National Security Council framework, addressing matters related to budgetary allocations and giving the Ministry greater capacity for engagement. Additionally, Mudavadi shared that Kenya is seeking ways to broaden its asset base in its missions abroad. A component of the sessional paper addresses diplomatic appointments, advocating that career diplomats should receive at least 70% of such appointments, with other experienced officers integrated at a minimum of 30%. “Once entrenched in the policy will clear the ambiguity and guide future nominations and appointments.” he stated. “We are facing fiscal difficulties and some of our missions are grappling with financial constraints but we are working on making sure that our diplomatic missions and the diplomats are not underfunded for this can also be very dangerous.” he added. The committee was chaired by Isiolo County Senator Fatuma Dullo."
From costly treatments to dietary changes: A journalist’s battle with rare condition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/your-condition-doesnt-define-you-it-refines-you/,2025-04-30T10:40:36+03:00,"Alvin Kaunda,AOSD","Alvin Kaunda, a budding journalist, had just landed his dream job at the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). He shot to fame when a baby elephant interrupted his piece-to-camera at an animal orphanage, a hilarious moment that quickly went viral. The clip was picked up by major international news outlets, catapulting him into the limelight and inspiring him to fully pursue his passion for wildlife journalism. “I enjoyed every bit of telling such stories. It was both fulfilling and rewarding,” says the young journalist. However, in June 2024, what initially seemed like normal fatigue from the demands of his work took a worrying turn when he developed a fever, body rash, and joint pain. What followed was chronic pain, prompting Alvin, who was living alone at the time, to travel home to Mombasa for further medical evaluation. During this period, his condition worsened, leading to hospitalisation as the mysterious illness gradually affected his mobility. During a second visit to a different hospital, he was diagnosed with sepsis, a serious medical condition where the body’s response to an infection triggers widespread inflammation, potentially resulting in tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) Although the diagnosis was devastating, Alvin felt a sense of relief that doctors had finally identified his illness and believed it could be treated. However, despite the initial prognosis, his condition failed to improve, leaving doctors puzzled once again. By then, Alvin had undergone over 20 medical tests in a desperate attempt to save his life. Eventually, he was discharged to manage his symptoms at home. During this time, his dreams, career, and love for wildlife expeditions began to fade; his only desire was to get well again. It was during one of his many outpatient visits that Alvin experienced a sudden attack. This was a turning point, as doctors witnessed the episode firsthand and ordered a ferritin test, a blood protein that contains iron and indicates how much iron the body stores. The test results revealed that Alvin had Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), a rare systemic autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks itself instead of providing protection. The disease is uncommon, affecting only about 1 in 100,000 people. Diet Changes Now, ten months later, Alvin, who relies on expensive treatments that include medication and regular testing to manage his overactive immune system, has been forced to make significant lifestyle changes, including a complete overhaul of his diet. “I’m still learning about the condition. There’s no cure for Still’s disease, but it can go into remission, and there is no time frame for this,” he told KBC Digital. “As a bachelor, I used to prefer fast food because it was convenient, but that had to change.” “Junk and processed foods are triggers for flare-ups, so I now stick to fresh ingredients and prepare my own meals, something I never imagined I’d do,” says the journalist, who lost his father to cancer just a month ago. “This condition has been a real eye-opener. The truth is, there are countless benefits to healthy eating. You don’t have to wait until you’re sick to make a change.” “I watched my dad change his diet tremendously after being diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. Since 2019, his eating habits were completely different, and he fought the disease bravely until March 9th, 2025, when he passed away at the age of 57,” he explains. “Living with AOSD, a non-curable condition, has completely changed my relationship with food. My diet is now part of my treatment. It helps me manage flare-ups, inflammation, and energy levels. To my peers: don’t underestimate the power of what you put on your plate. It can truly be medicine,” he continues. Alvin, who at the time of publication was experiencing an episode, further shared insights into managing the condition while reflecting on the financial burden, which he admits ‘feels heavier than the illness itself.’ “My condition requires lifelong management with medications like methotrexate, a type of DMARD (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug), regular blood tests, doctor consultations, and at times, emergency care during flare-ups. These treatments aren’t optional; they are necessary to keep me going and to manage my pain, inflammation, fatigue, and the risks that come with a suppressed immune system. But it comes at a cost. Every hospital visit, every blood test, and every prescription add up. And because AOSD is a rare autoimmune disease, not all treatments are covered or even easily available,” he points out. He adds, “I’m sharing this just to highlight what so many people with chronic and rare diseases face. We fight not only our symptoms but also a system that often overlooks the financial burden of being unwell. Healthcare shouldn’t be a privilege; it should be a right. And rare conditions like AOSD deserve more awareness, better support, and more affordable treatment options.” Although Alvin may have slowed down on his wildlife expeditions, his perspective on life has changed, and he believes every day is a gift to continue raising awareness of Still’s disease and to participate in advocacy efforts primarily focused on NCDs. “I live more intentionally now. Every good day is a gift. My condition has taught me not to take health for granted and to prioritise balance, joy, and rest. Life may not go back to what it was before diagnosis—but it can still be full, meaningful, and impactful,” he says. Warning Labels While many factors can increase the risk of developing an autoimmune condition, nutrition may also influence the risk and severity of these diseases. Concerns are growing over the rising prevalence of diet-related diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, among children and young people—conditions that were previously associated only with older adults. In light of this situation, various stakeholders, including the church (NCCK), are advocating for the promotion of healthy eating habits through policy interventions, such as implementing Front-of-Pack Warning Labels (FOPWL) on food products. This initiative aims to empower consumers to make more informed choices about their purchases. “If Kenya were to adopt black octagonal warning labels on foods with high levels of nutrients linked to NCDs, it would be a step in the right direction to reduce the excessive consumption of junk food, which poses significant health risks,” notes Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist and programme officer at IILA. Their advocacy efforts are yielding results; Kenya, through the Ministry of Health, is set to launch its first Nutrition Profile Model next month. This key document will lay the groundwork for developing regulations that require food manufacturers to display clear warning labels on the front of food packaging, informing consumers about high levels of unhealthy nutrients such as sugar, sodium, saturated fats, and trans fats. Additionally, regulations aimed at countering aggressive commercial marketing that targets NCD risk factors in children and young people will also be considered. Alvin is among those who welcome this significant milestone, hopeful that one day the government will enact food policies and regulations that will save lives. “To the food and beverage industry, I personally feel that they have a massive role to play in public health. As someone living with a non-curable disease, I rely on food not just for nutrition, but for survival. The upcoming nutrient profile model is an opportunity to raise the standard. Create products that nourish, not harm. Label them clearly. Remove harmful additives,” he appeals. He presents another challenge to all: “We should move from marketing what is addictive to producing what is actually healing. Consumers deserve transparency, and those of us living with lifelong conditions deserve better choices. To policymakers: support access to affordable, nutritious food; it’s a basic right. And to others fighting incurable diseases—focus on what you can control, and let food be one of your tools for healing and strength.” He signs off with a heartfelt message of encouragement to everyone navigating life with a chronic illness. ” Your condition doesn’t define you; it refines you. Take it one step at a time. There will be tough days, but you’re not alone. Your strength lies in showing up, even when it’s hard. Find a routine that works for you, and don’t be afraid to advocate for your needs.” WATCH THE VIDEO"

This will involve substantial revisions to the initial budget estimates of KSh4.3 trillion and broader austerity measures. The Cabinet meeting that was chaired by President William Ruto on Tuesday at State House Nairobi, also approved the Finance Bill, 2025, which focuses on closing loopholes and enhancing efficiency. According to a statement from the cabinet, the bill aims to streamline tax refund processes, reduce tax disputes, and amend key tax laws, including the Income Tax Act, VAT Act, Excise Duty Act, and Tax Procedures Act. “Importantly, the Bill seeks to minimise tax-raising measures. Instead, it aims to enhance tax administration efficiency through a new legislative framework.” Read the statement. The Bill proposes critical changes to support small businesses, allowing them to fully deduct the cost of everyday tools and equipment in the year of purchase, thereby eliminating unnecessary delays in accessing tax relief. In addition, retirees will benefit significantly as all gratuity payments, whether in public or private pension schemes, will now be fully tax-exempt, ensuring dignity for Kenya’s senior citizens after retirement. Employers will also be required to automatically apply all eligible tax reliefs and exemptions when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes for employees. Currently, many employers omit these reliefs, forcing employees to seek refunds from the Kenya Revenue Authority. Similarly, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024 which mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds. “In a move to ensure predictability and strengthen emergency preparedness, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This Bill mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds.” The statement read. According to the Cabinet, the decision follows the serious gaps exposed by the 2023 El Nino rains and stems from extensive consultations and a directive issued at the 24th Ordinary Session of the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council (IBEC) in August 2024. The Bill further dedicates pension and retirement benefits framework for judges of the superior courts was endorsed, aiming to ensure their financial security and protect judicial independence. “Serving judges will be under a Defined Benefit system, while new appointees will be under a Defined Contribution system. The bill also provides enhanced retirement benefits, including medical coverage and diplomatic privileges.” Cabinet resolved. The Cabinet also approved the construction of two Level VI teaching and referral hospitals in Bungoma and Kericho counties in partnership with the African Development Bank to improve access to quality healthcare. Capital Markets Act Amendments were approved by Cabinet, the amendments are meant to remove shareholder limits in regulated institutions to stimulate investment and deepen financial markets. Additionally, the Cabinet approved the Draft Pest Control Products Bill, 2024 which modernizes the regulation of pest control products, establishes the Pest Control Products Authority, and aims to enhance safety and standards in the sector. The Cabinet approved the establishment of a Consulate General in Port-au-Prince, Haiti noting that the consulate will provide strategic support to Kenya’s leadership role in restoring law and order in Haiti."
Some reckless MPs planned to travel to Taiwan during Ruto’s visit to China – Mudavadi,https://www.kbc.co.ke/some-reckless-mps-planned-to-travel-to-taiwan-during-rutos-visit-to-china-mudavadi/,2025-04-29T18:59:57+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has described as reckless and malicious an attempt by some MPs to travel to Taiwan during the period when President William Ruto was touring China. Mudavadi stated that the legislators’ plan to visit Taiwan was intended to undermine the government’s efforts to strengthen its relationship with China, which he deemed unpatriotic and provocative. Speaking during question time at the Senate, while appearing before the Senate Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, Mudavadi emphasized that such a move would have been provocative. “We know, there were some people who were pushing to have a delegation from Parliament to go to Taiwan when the President of Kenya is visiting China for a State visit. It could have cost the country a lot,” said Mudavadi. He noted that there are certain issues that the country and, particularly, elected leaders need to be aware of, as they can have serious and devastating implications for the broader welfare of the nation. During his trip to China, President Ruto declared that Kenya supports the One-China policy, a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, and dialogue to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He stated that during the state visit to China, Kenya secured benefits that could significantly alter the country’s economic situation, and that some were displeased with the government’s achievements. “There were some who did not want the government to achieve anything in the visit, today, once the agreed projects are in place we will have an SGR to the border of Uganda at the Malaba and a dual road to same destination, this will spare economic growth in the regions of Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western,” said Mudavadi. He urged parliamentarians to be patriotic and to conduct themselves in a way that sets a good example and influences the younger generation positively. On investments in Kenya’s foreign embassies, Mudavadi mentioned that Kenya is now engaging in a policy to explore how to develop its assets abroad, as outlined in the policy document being worked on by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with Parliament. “We want to use the exchequer, and where we can, also have public-private partnerships. I say so because if you go to Upper Hill today, and I was the guest of honor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tanzania came and we jointly broke ground where the pension fund, Tanzania pension fund, is putting up a 22-story building,” said the PCS. He explained that the building is for the Tanzanian embassy but will also serve as a revenue-generating asset for the Tanzanian government, allowing them to lease out the additional space they do not require. Mudavadi noted that similar initiatives have taken place in several countries. For example, Uganda has a prime building in New York, not far from the UN headquarters, as well as a significant building in Trafalgar Square in London, and Uganda House in Nairobi. “We have a plan to be able to start making serious investment proposals for the assets that we have so that we can maximize the returns and draw, which can then help in funding our missions, more robustly as we go into the future,” said Mudavadi."

The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) asserts that media companies must ensure that all gambling advertisements undergo vetting and approval as part of a government initiative aimed at promoting responsible gambling and protecting the public from unregulated gambling content. “Media companies are directed not to air unclassified gambling advertisements on their platforms, in accordance with the Films and Stage Plays Act, Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya,” stated Paskal Opiyo, the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the board. This directive from the KFCB follows an order from the Executive Office of the President, communicated through the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB), regarding the suspension of gambling advertisements. Additionally, KFCB has instructed gambling companies to obtain filming licences for their recorded advertisements through the Technical Management System (TMS) and to submit these advertisements to the KFCB for classification and the issuance of a Certificate of Approval."
Kenya rejects Sudan’s SAF claims of involvement in ongoing conflict,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-rejects-sudans-saf-claims-of-involvement-in-ongoing-conflict/,2025-04-29T13:58:48+03:00,,"The Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs has dismissed claims made by Sudan’s SAF administration, shifting blame to Kenya for the tragic and ongoing conflict that has afflicted the country for over two years. In a statement, the Ministry described the allegations as unfounded and reiterated that Kenya is solely interested in a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Sudan. “While it is not in Kenya’s interest to engage in needless exchanges, especially on a matter so grievous and intractable, it is nonetheless incumbent to put the record straight and to urge people and nations of goodwill to disregard those tirades as baseless,” the Ministry stated. The Musalia Mudavadi-led Ministry explained that, contrary to the accusations, Kenya’s leadership has never taken sides in the situation in Sudan. “In an effort to find a negotiated settlement, Kenya has met leaders of the two main warring sides in Nairobi, both simultaneously and at separate intervals, in accordance with its unrivalled credentials for peaceful conflict mediation,” the Ministry stated. “Recently, some Sudanese nationals gathered in Nairobi to discuss issues affecting their country and adopted a roadmap. The convening of this dialogue forum in our capital, Nairobi, or elsewhere on Kenya’s territory, neither equates to endorsing any forum’s outcome nor constitutes the formation of an exile government as has been alleged,” the Ministry added. The Ministry insists that as long as the conflict remains unresolved, it will continue to concern the region and the world at large. Kenya will not remain passive and has therefore urged key players in the conflict in Sudan to seek a pathway to peaceful resolution and end the bloodletting."

Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School.

The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."

The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."

Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana. Kibaki akasema leteni gazeti zote za wiki, na kuagiza kila headline isomwe. Mwisho akasema mnaona kila siku headline inabadilika, kwa hivyo headline isiwafanye mkose kufanya kazi. Focus is very key since the headline that does not change the unity and development of all Kenyans,” said Mudavadi. “Na nyinyi watu wa mlima mkiteleza, mjue sisi tuko tayari tutachukua. Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed.

Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana.

New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners.

Addressing Kenyan professionals, community leaders and industry pioneers during a fireside chat on Thursday evening in Doha, Qatar, PS Njogu underscored the civic and patriotic responsibility of the diaspora to safeguard Kenya’s reputation and counter negative publicity. She highlighted the significant impact of the diaspora in championing Kenya’s interests internationally, urging attendees to actively mention Kenya when discussing investment opportunities, tourism, ICT, skilled workforce, and other key topics in influential spaces and decision-making forums. Accompanied by Ambassador Mohamed Nur Adan, Kenya’s envoy to Qatar, PS Njogu also stressed the importance of knowledge and skills transfer from the diaspora to drive Kenya’s socio-economic progress. She noted that leveraging international expertise acquired abroad is essential for advancing national development. On environmental stewardship, PS Njogu called on the more than 70,000 Kenyans in Qatar to support Kenya’s ambitious goal of growing 15 billion trees by 2032. She encouraged the community to collectively adopt a forest, contributing to increased tree and forest cover. PS Njogu also urged the diaspora to take advantage of government initiatives such as DhowCSD, which offers opportunities to invest in government securities, and to explore prospects in health, tourism, ICT, manufacturing, sports, and agriculture to expand their investment portfolios. The PS also used the session to update Kenyans in Doha of Government programmes back home under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda(BETA) and the importance to the citizenry.

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand.

"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."
"Finance Bill 2025 will bring great benefits to Kenyans, says President Ruto",https://www.kbc.co.ke/finance-bill-2025-will-bring-great-benefits-to-kenyans-says-president-ruto/,2025-05-01T17:31:26+03:00,,"President William Ruto announced on Thursday that the proposed Finance Bill 2025 will offer significant benefits to Kenyans. He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised. The submission comes at a time of growing global climate anxiety and provides a rare beacon of leadership from the Global South. Kenya’s call to the international community is clear: back bold action with real support. “With this submission, Kenya invites the world to partner in unlocking sustainable development opportunities that will shape a greener, more inclusive future for all,” Dr. Barasa added."

He underscored his mission to implement lasting changes for the nation’s development. Speaking in Karen, Nairobi, during the installation of Dr Benard Chitunga as the Chancellor of The Co-operative University of Kenya, Ruto reiterated that having been granted the mandate to lead the country, he has a responsibility to bring about change. He assured Kenyans that he will deliver, despite prevailing skepticism. “Many people may not believe what I am saying, but you will be shocked. I am going to confound the naysayers,” he stated. According to the head of state, leadership requires making the right decisions, even if they are not immediately popular. He cited the changes his administration implemented regarding the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). “I undertook to the people of Kenya that I was going to change the savings culture. You all remember that everyone used to pay NSSF Ksh 200 until 2023, and that was okay. Explain to me why Ksh 200 is okay. How is Ksh 200 going to amount to savings?” he posed Ruto defended the decision to increase the amount contributed by Kenyans to the NSSF, asserting that it is already yielding positive results. “We made the right decision. Today, every Kenyan is saving 6% of their salary, and every employer is saving 6% on behalf of their employees. We have some statistics. From independence up to 2023, we saved Ksh 320 billion. That’s in 60 years. However, in just two years, from 2023 to the present, we have saved Ksh 280 billion,” he said. “Uganda has a bigger social security fund than Kenya although they have a quarter of our economy. Tanzania has a bigger national social security fund, even though they have 50% of our economy. Why? Because they made the right decisions about savings,” Ruto explained, providing a comparative analysis of the situation in Kenya and its neighbours. “In Uganda, everybody saves 10% of their salary, and in Tanzania, everybody saves 8% of their salary. But in Kenya, we were saving Ksh 200, and that was supposed to be okay and I was supposed to do nothing about it,” he added. By the end of this year, the president stated that the country will have doubled the amount saved through the NSSF over the past 60 years, and by 2027, a trillion shillings will have been saved “because we have made some bold decisions.”"

Mudavadi, who also serves as the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, informed the Senate Standing Committee on National Security, Defence, and Foreign Relations that the overarching strategy is to shift the policy from the confines of the ministry and make it citizen-centred. He stated that anchoring the policy in law with parliamentary input will place Kenya’s interests at the forefront in an ever-changing global environment. “We want our international and diplomatic engagements to help improve the livelihoods and welfare of every Kenyan as we protect the interests of our country which come first.” said Mudavadi. He further explained to the committee, which sought statements about shaping Kenya’s global image, that the swift changes in the global environment necessitated a review of the policy with a focus on pragmatism, foresight, and long-term perspective. “What we are curing is the traditional way of doing things under hidden cameras, we need to be transparent and forthright in our engagements and be accountable to the citizens in our foreign engagements.” said Mudavadi. “Once we actualize the sessional paper, we will adopt a number of reforms including making public treaties and agreements signed with other countries, once approved by parliamentary. This will help the public to understand areas where they feel they can engage and invest abroad among other benefits,” Mudavadi explained. He also informed the committee that transparency in the issuance of scholarships would be a key aspect of the sessional paper, aiming to eliminate the inequality and unfairness seen in the past. Mudavadi stressed that all Kenyans should have equitable access to opportunities that benefit the country, including those available in the education sector abroad. “Every part of Kenya must get an equal opportunity when it comes to sharing of such opportunities like scholarships. Even if we later decide to bond the students in giving back to the nation once they have graduated, this must be done with fairness and transparency. Scholarships are not a military secret. The sessional paper will outline how the beneficiaries will be identified and the criteria will be known for Kenyans to appreciate that indeed there was transparency.” Mudavadi detailed. “We are also looking at how to deal with the unscrupulous travel agents and agencies that lure Kenyans and dupe innocent citizens when it comes to securing job opportunities abroad. We want to put measures that the Ministry will use to sensitize the citizens so that they are not swindled and left high and dry.” added the Prime CS. Mudavadi, in response to a question about protecting Kenyans seeking jobs abroad, stated that Parliament should assist the Ministry in strengthening laws to prosecute rogue agencies. He also emphasised the need to sensitise and caution Kenyans about regions that are no-go zones, where they may face the risk of human trafficking or slavery. “Our engagements with parliament or even other institution is to help save lives. This is a campaign that should be wholesome. The awareness should not be left for the ministry or government, since when Kenyans suffer abroad it pains many back homes.” said Mudavadi. “As a ministry we are also cautioning Kenyans that once you are wheels-up, the moment you land on the soils of the other country, the laws that govern your stay once the plane has landed are the laws of the foreign country.” said Mudavadi as he urged Parliament to help in enacting laws that will help the ministry navigate legal processes for Kenyans incarcerated abroad. “When you get involved in a traffic offense abroad or you are caught in a brawl in a night club then you want the case to be a Kenyan problem, and yet we don’t have monetary provisions to help in dealing with such cases, you are putting us in a tight corner. Especially to our young people who still want to adventure, they need to be cautious of the same.” Mudavadi reiterated He also informed the committee that the sessional paper aims to embed the foreign affairs portfolio within the National Security Council framework, addressing matters related to budgetary allocations and giving the Ministry greater capacity for engagement. Additionally, Mudavadi shared that Kenya is seeking ways to broaden its asset base in its missions abroad. A component of the sessional paper addresses diplomatic appointments, advocating that career diplomats should receive at least 70% of such appointments, with other experienced officers integrated at a minimum of 30%. “Once entrenched in the policy will clear the ambiguity and guide future nominations and appointments.” he stated. “We are facing fiscal difficulties and some of our missions are grappling with financial constraints but we are working on making sure that our diplomatic missions and the diplomats are not underfunded for this can also be very dangerous.” he added. The committee was chaired by Isiolo County Senator Fatuma Dullo."
From costly treatments to dietary changes: A journalist’s battle with rare condition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/your-condition-doesnt-define-you-it-refines-you/,2025-04-30T10:40:36+03:00,"Alvin Kaunda,AOSD","Alvin Kaunda, a budding journalist, had just landed his dream job at the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). He shot to fame when a baby elephant interrupted his piece-to-camera at an animal orphanage, a hilarious moment that quickly went viral. The clip was picked up by major international news outlets, catapulting him into the limelight and inspiring him to fully pursue his passion for wildlife journalism. “I enjoyed every bit of telling such stories. It was both fulfilling and rewarding,” says the young journalist. However, in June 2024, what initially seemed like normal fatigue from the demands of his work took a worrying turn when he developed a fever, body rash, and joint pain. What followed was chronic pain, prompting Alvin, who was living alone at the time, to travel home to Mombasa for further medical evaluation. During this period, his condition worsened, leading to hospitalisation as the mysterious illness gradually affected his mobility. During a second visit to a different hospital, he was diagnosed with sepsis, a serious medical condition where the body’s response to an infection triggers widespread inflammation, potentially resulting in tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) Although the diagnosis was devastating, Alvin felt a sense of relief that doctors had finally identified his illness and believed it could be treated. However, despite the initial prognosis, his condition failed to improve, leaving doctors puzzled once again. By then, Alvin had undergone over 20 medical tests in a desperate attempt to save his life. Eventually, he was discharged to manage his symptoms at home. During this time, his dreams, career, and love for wildlife expeditions began to fade; his only desire was to get well again. It was during one of his many outpatient visits that Alvin experienced a sudden attack. This was a turning point, as doctors witnessed the episode firsthand and ordered a ferritin test, a blood protein that contains iron and indicates how much iron the body stores. The test results revealed that Alvin had Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), a rare systemic autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks itself instead of providing protection. The disease is uncommon, affecting only about 1 in 100,000 people. Diet Changes Now, ten months later, Alvin, who relies on expensive treatments that include medication and regular testing to manage his overactive immune system, has been forced to make significant lifestyle changes, including a complete overhaul of his diet. “I’m still learning about the condition. There’s no cure for Still’s disease, but it can go into remission, and there is no time frame for this,” he told KBC Digital. “As a bachelor, I used to prefer fast food because it was convenient, but that had to change.” “Junk and processed foods are triggers for flare-ups, so I now stick to fresh ingredients and prepare my own meals, something I never imagined I’d do,” says the journalist, who lost his father to cancer just a month ago. “This condition has been a real eye-opener. The truth is, there are countless benefits to healthy eating. You don’t have to wait until you’re sick to make a change.” “I watched my dad change his diet tremendously after being diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. Since 2019, his eating habits were completely different, and he fought the disease bravely until March 9th, 2025, when he passed away at the age of 57,” he explains. “Living with AOSD, a non-curable condition, has completely changed my relationship with food. My diet is now part of my treatment. It helps me manage flare-ups, inflammation, and energy levels. To my peers: don’t underestimate the power of what you put on your plate. It can truly be medicine,” he continues. Alvin, who at the time of publication was experiencing an episode, further shared insights into managing the condition while reflecting on the financial burden, which he admits ‘feels heavier than the illness itself.’ “My condition requires lifelong management with medications like methotrexate, a type of DMARD (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug), regular blood tests, doctor consultations, and at times, emergency care during flare-ups. These treatments aren’t optional; they are necessary to keep me going and to manage my pain, inflammation, fatigue, and the risks that come with a suppressed immune system. But it comes at a cost. Every hospital visit, every blood test, and every prescription add up. And because AOSD is a rare autoimmune disease, not all treatments are covered or even easily available,” he points out. He adds, “I’m sharing this just to highlight what so many people with chronic and rare diseases face. We fight not only our symptoms but also a system that often overlooks the financial burden of being unwell. Healthcare shouldn’t be a privilege; it should be a right. And rare conditions like AOSD deserve more awareness, better support, and more affordable treatment options.” Although Alvin may have slowed down on his wildlife expeditions, his perspective on life has changed, and he believes every day is a gift to continue raising awareness of Still’s disease and to participate in advocacy efforts primarily focused on NCDs. “I live more intentionally now. Every good day is a gift. My condition has taught me not to take health for granted and to prioritise balance, joy, and rest. Life may not go back to what it was before diagnosis—but it can still be full, meaningful, and impactful,” he says. Warning Labels While many factors can increase the risk of developing an autoimmune condition, nutrition may also influence the risk and severity of these diseases. Concerns are growing over the rising prevalence of diet-related diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, among children and young people—conditions that were previously associated only with older adults. In light of this situation, various stakeholders, including the church (NCCK), are advocating for the promotion of healthy eating habits through policy interventions, such as implementing Front-of-Pack Warning Labels (FOPWL) on food products. This initiative aims to empower consumers to make more informed choices about their purchases. “If Kenya were to adopt black octagonal warning labels on foods with high levels of nutrients linked to NCDs, it would be a step in the right direction to reduce the excessive consumption of junk food, which poses significant health risks,” notes Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist and programme officer at IILA. Their advocacy efforts are yielding results; Kenya, through the Ministry of Health, is set to launch its first Nutrition Profile Model next month. This key document will lay the groundwork for developing regulations that require food manufacturers to display clear warning labels on the front of food packaging, informing consumers about high levels of unhealthy nutrients such as sugar, sodium, saturated fats, and trans fats. Additionally, regulations aimed at countering aggressive commercial marketing that targets NCD risk factors in children and young people will also be considered. Alvin is among those who welcome this significant milestone, hopeful that one day the government will enact food policies and regulations that will save lives. “To the food and beverage industry, I personally feel that they have a massive role to play in public health. As someone living with a non-curable disease, I rely on food not just for nutrition, but for survival. The upcoming nutrient profile model is an opportunity to raise the standard. Create products that nourish, not harm. Label them clearly. Remove harmful additives,” he appeals. He presents another challenge to all: “We should move from marketing what is addictive to producing what is actually healing. Consumers deserve transparency, and those of us living with lifelong conditions deserve better choices. To policymakers: support access to affordable, nutritious food; it’s a basic right. And to others fighting incurable diseases—focus on what you can control, and let food be one of your tools for healing and strength.” He signs off with a heartfelt message of encouragement to everyone navigating life with a chronic illness. ” Your condition doesn’t define you; it refines you. Take it one step at a time. There will be tough days, but you’re not alone. Your strength lies in showing up, even when it’s hard. Find a routine that works for you, and don’t be afraid to advocate for your needs.” WATCH THE VIDEO"
"Cabinet backs austerity measures, approves Finance Bill",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cabinet-backs-austerity-measures-approves-finance-bill-targeting-loopholes/,2025-04-30T07:00:04+03:00,"Austerity measures,Cabinet","The Cabinet has resolved to realign the budget to cap the fiscal deficit at a maximum of 4.5% of GDP in the 2025/26 financial year, a reduction from previous years, with a medium-term target of 2.7%. This will involve substantial revisions to the initial budget estimates of KSh4.3 trillion and broader austerity measures. The Cabinet meeting that was chaired by President William Ruto on Tuesday at State House Nairobi, also approved the Finance Bill, 2025, which focuses on closing loopholes and enhancing efficiency. According to a statement from the cabinet, the bill aims to streamline tax refund processes, reduce tax disputes, and amend key tax laws, including the Income Tax Act, VAT Act, Excise Duty Act, and Tax Procedures Act. “Importantly, the Bill seeks to minimise tax-raising measures. Instead, it aims to enhance tax administration efficiency through a new legislative framework.” Read the statement. The Bill proposes critical changes to support small businesses, allowing them to fully deduct the cost of everyday tools and equipment in the year of purchase, thereby eliminating unnecessary delays in accessing tax relief. In addition, retirees will benefit significantly as all gratuity payments, whether in public or private pension schemes, will now be fully tax-exempt, ensuring dignity for Kenya’s senior citizens after retirement. Employers will also be required to automatically apply all eligible tax reliefs and exemptions when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes for employees. Currently, many employers omit these reliefs, forcing employees to seek refunds from the Kenya Revenue Authority. Similarly, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024 which mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds. “In a move to ensure predictability and strengthen emergency preparedness, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This Bill mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds.” The statement read. According to the Cabinet, the decision follows the serious gaps exposed by the 2023 El Nino rains and stems from extensive consultations and a directive issued at the 24th Ordinary Session of the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council (IBEC) in August 2024. The Bill further dedicates pension and retirement benefits framework for judges of the superior courts was endorsed, aiming to ensure their financial security and protect judicial independence. “Serving judges will be under a Defined Benefit system, while new appointees will be under a Defined Contribution system. The bill also provides enhanced retirement benefits, including medical coverage and diplomatic privileges.” Cabinet resolved. The Cabinet also approved the construction of two Level VI teaching and referral hospitals in Bungoma and Kericho counties in partnership with the African Development Bank to improve access to quality healthcare. Capital Markets Act Amendments were approved by Cabinet, the amendments are meant to remove shareholder limits in regulated institutions to stimulate investment and deepen financial markets. Additionally, the Cabinet approved the Draft Pest Control Products Bill, 2024 which modernizes the regulation of pest control products, establishes the Pest Control Products Authority, and aims to enhance safety and standards in the sector. The Cabinet approved the establishment of a Consulate General in Port-au-Prince, Haiti noting that the consulate will provide strategic support to Kenya’s leadership role in restoring law and order in Haiti."
Some reckless MPs planned to travel to Taiwan during Ruto’s visit to China – Mudavadi,https://www.kbc.co.ke/some-reckless-mps-planned-to-travel-to-taiwan-during-rutos-visit-to-china-mudavadi/,2025-04-29T18:59:57+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has described as reckless and malicious an attempt by some MPs to travel to Taiwan during the period when President William Ruto was touring China. Mudavadi stated that the legislators’ plan to visit Taiwan was intended to undermine the government’s efforts to strengthen its relationship with China, which he deemed unpatriotic and provocative. Speaking during question time at the Senate, while appearing before the Senate Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, Mudavadi emphasized that such a move would have been provocative. “We know, there were some people who were pushing to have a delegation from Parliament to go to Taiwan when the President of Kenya is visiting China for a State visit. It could have cost the country a lot,” said Mudavadi. He noted that there are certain issues that the country and, particularly, elected leaders need to be aware of, as they can have serious and devastating implications for the broader welfare of the nation. During his trip to China, President Ruto declared that Kenya supports the One-China policy, a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, and dialogue to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He stated that during the state visit to China, Kenya secured benefits that could significantly alter the country’s economic situation, and that some were displeased with the government’s achievements. “There were some who did not want the government to achieve anything in the visit, today, once the agreed projects are in place we will have an SGR to the border of Uganda at the Malaba and a dual road to same destination, this will spare economic growth in the regions of Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western,” said Mudavadi. He urged parliamentarians to be patriotic and to conduct themselves in a way that sets a good example and influences the younger generation positively. On investments in Kenya’s foreign embassies, Mudavadi mentioned that Kenya is now engaging in a policy to explore how to develop its assets abroad, as outlined in the policy document being worked on by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with Parliament. “We want to use the exchequer, and where we can, also have public-private partnerships. I say so because if you go to Upper Hill today, and I was the guest of honor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tanzania came and we jointly broke ground where the pension fund, Tanzania pension fund, is putting up a 22-story building,” said the PCS. He explained that the building is for the Tanzanian embassy but will also serve as a revenue-generating asset for the Tanzanian government, allowing them to lease out the additional space they do not require. Mudavadi noted that similar initiatives have taken place in several countries. For example, Uganda has a prime building in New York, not far from the UN headquarters, as well as a significant building in Trafalgar Square in London, and Uganda House in Nairobi. “We have a plan to be able to start making serious investment proposals for the assets that we have so that we can maximize the returns and draw, which can then help in funding our missions, more robustly as we go into the future,” said Mudavadi."
Media instructed not to broadcast unclassified gambling adverts,https://www.kbc.co.ke/media-instructed-not-to-broadcast-unclassified-gambling-adverts/,2025-04-29T17:55:58+03:00,,"Media outlets operating in Kenya have been directed to refrain from broadcasting unclassified gambling advertisements. The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) asserts that media companies must ensure that all gambling advertisements undergo vetting and approval as part of a government initiative aimed at promoting responsible gambling and protecting the public from unregulated gambling content. “Media companies are directed not to air unclassified gambling advertisements on their platforms, in accordance with the Films and Stage Plays Act, Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya,” stated Paskal Opiyo, the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the board. This directive from the KFCB follows an order from the Executive Office of the President, communicated through the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB), regarding the suspension of gambling advertisements. Additionally, KFCB has instructed gambling companies to obtain filming licences for their recorded advertisements through the Technical Management System (TMS) and to submit these advertisements to the KFCB for classification and the issuance of a Certificate of Approval."
Kenya rejects Sudan’s SAF claims of involvement in ongoing conflict,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-rejects-sudans-saf-claims-of-involvement-in-ongoing-conflict/,2025-04-29T13:58:48+03:00,,"The Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs has dismissed claims made by Sudan’s SAF administration, shifting blame to Kenya for the tragic and ongoing conflict that has afflicted the country for over two years. In a statement, the Ministry described the allegations as unfounded and reiterated that Kenya is solely interested in a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Sudan. “While it is not in Kenya’s interest to engage in needless exchanges, especially on a matter so grievous and intractable, it is nonetheless incumbent to put the record straight and to urge people and nations of goodwill to disregard those tirades as baseless,” the Ministry stated. The Musalia Mudavadi-led Ministry explained that, contrary to the accusations, Kenya’s leadership has never taken sides in the situation in Sudan. “In an effort to find a negotiated settlement, Kenya has met leaders of the two main warring sides in Nairobi, both simultaneously and at separate intervals, in accordance with its unrivalled credentials for peaceful conflict mediation,” the Ministry stated. “Recently, some Sudanese nationals gathered in Nairobi to discuss issues affecting their country and adopted a roadmap. The convening of this dialogue forum in our capital, Nairobi, or elsewhere on Kenya’s territory, neither equates to endorsing any forum’s outcome nor constitutes the formation of an exile government as has been alleged,” the Ministry added. The Ministry insists that as long as the conflict remains unresolved, it will continue to concern the region and the world at large. Kenya will not remain passive and has therefore urged key players in the conflict in Sudan to seek a pathway to peaceful resolution and end the bloodletting."

The Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) announced the suspension on April 29, 2025, citing the growing concern over the proliferation of gambling activities and misleading advertising. In a statement, BCLB Chairperson Dr. Jane Mwikali Makau said the Board had noted an alarming trend where gambling promoters were portraying betting as a legitimate investment opportunity and a shortcut to wealth. She warned that such misrepresentations were having devastating social and economic impacts on individuals, families, and communities. Dr. Makau also expressed concern over the widespread airing of gambling advertisements during the watershed hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., saying this exposed minors to betting content and contributed to growing addiction cases. To address the issue, the BCLB ordered the immediate halt of all gambling-related advertisements and promotional content across all media platforms, including TV, radio, print, social media, billboards, SMS, email campaigns and influencer endorsements. During the suspension period, all licensed gambling operators have been instructed to submit their advertisements to the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) for vetting and classification in accordance with the Film and Stage Plays Act. The BCLB further directed operators to ensure full compliance with existing gambling laws and implement responsible gambling practices as part of their licensing conditions. In addition to the suspension, the government has established a Multi-Agency Enforcement Team tasked with creating strategic interventions and enforcing responsible gambling regulations. The team comprises representatives from key government bodies, including the Ministry of Interior, Office of the Attorney General, the Communications Authority of Kenya, Kenya Revenue Authority, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, KFCB, the Media Council of Kenya, Financial Reporting Centre, and the BCLB itself. The BCLB also urged Parliament to fast-track the Gambling Control Bill, which is expected to give regulators enhanced supervisory powers. It further called on the Media Council of Kenya to finalise new advertising guidelines, following a court ruling that nullified the previous programming code. Members of the public were encouraged to report any violations or suspicious gambling operations directly to the BCLB or the nearest police station for investigation. The Board emphasised its commitment to protecting the youth, promoting social responsibility, and restoring integrity in Kenya’s gambling sector."
