Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

Capitalising on the current relevance of the song following a security incident in Migori that saw President William Ruto hit by a shoe while addressing a crowd, band member Mordecai Dex announced his first-ever live show. “On May 10th 2014, “Uliza Kiatu” our debut single, dropped on all streaming platforms.

The song on YouTube currently stands at 4.8M views, and the video directed by Kevin Bosco has seen an uptick in viewership following the Migori debacle.

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."

But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s.

News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."

It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."

Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

Capitalising on the current relevance of the song following a security incident in Migori that saw President William Ruto hit by a shoe while addressing a crowd, band member Mordecai Dex announced his first-ever live show. “On May 10th 2014, “Uliza Kiatu” our debut single, dropped on all streaming platforms.

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."
MTV Shuga to premiere on YouTube on May 14,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mtv-shuga-to-premiere-on-youtube-on-may-14/,2025-05-05T12:59:57+03:00,"culture,Kenyan cast","MTV Shuga Mashariki, the latest chapter of the iconic Shuga franchise by the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, will be available globally on MTV Shuga’s YouTube channel starting May 14, with new episodes every Wednesday at 8 PM EAT. The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."
Marvel’s ‘Thunderbolts tops weekend Box Office,https://www.kbc.co.ke/marvels-thunderbolts-tops-weekend-box-office/,2025-05-05T09:42:14+03:00,"Box Office,Film","New Marvel superhero film “Thunderbolts” triumphed over the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million in a promising start to the summer movie season, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday. “Thunderbolts” features Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell and David Harbour as a motley bunch of antiheroes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
Brazil police foil Lady Gaga gig bomb plot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/brazil-police-foil-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot/,2025-05-04T19:09:46+03:00,"BRAZIL,Lady Gaga","Brazilian police said Sunday they had arrested two people in connection with a foiled plot to attack Lady Gaga’s packed mega-concert in Rio de Janeiro. Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar.

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

The song on YouTube currently stands at 4.8M views, and the video directed by Kevin Bosco has seen an uptick in viewership following the Migori debacle.

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."
MTV Shuga to premiere on YouTube on May 14,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mtv-shuga-to-premiere-on-youtube-on-may-14/,2025-05-05T12:59:57+03:00,"culture,Kenyan cast","MTV Shuga Mashariki, the latest chapter of the iconic Shuga franchise by the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, will be available globally on MTV Shuga’s YouTube channel starting May 14, with new episodes every Wednesday at 8 PM EAT. The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."
Marvel’s ‘Thunderbolts tops weekend Box Office,https://www.kbc.co.ke/marvels-thunderbolts-tops-weekend-box-office/,2025-05-05T09:42:14+03:00,"Box Office,Film","New Marvel superhero film “Thunderbolts” triumphed over the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million in a promising start to the summer movie season, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday. “Thunderbolts” features Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell and David Harbour as a motley bunch of antiheroes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
Brazil police foil Lady Gaga gig bomb plot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/brazil-police-foil-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot/,2025-05-04T19:09:46+03:00,"BRAZIL,Lady Gaga","Brazilian police said Sunday they had arrested two people in connection with a foiled plot to attack Lady Gaga’s packed mega-concert in Rio de Janeiro. Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."
MTV Shuga to premiere on YouTube on May 14,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mtv-shuga-to-premiere-on-youtube-on-may-14/,2025-05-05T12:59:57+03:00,"culture,Kenyan cast","MTV Shuga Mashariki, the latest chapter of the iconic Shuga franchise by the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, will be available globally on MTV Shuga’s YouTube channel starting May 14, with new episodes every Wednesday at 8 PM EAT. The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations.

Spotify introduces AI playlist feature to Kenyan market as part of global expansion,https://www.kbc.co.ke/spotify-introduces-ai-playlist-feature-to-kenyan-market-as-part-of-global-expansion/,2025-05-02T09:37:12+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Spotify has rolled out its AI Playlist feature to Premium users in Kenya, part of a broader expansion that includes more than 40 new markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar. Playlists can be further refined with prompts like “more upbeat” or “happier songs.” Spotify recommends using genre, mood, or artist-based prompts for the best results, but says even unconventional ideas involving emojis, movie characters or colours can be used. Suggested prompts to explore include: The company says it is still learning from user interactions with the feature and will continue to improve it ahead of a wider release."
"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gina Din book to become film,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gina-din-book-to-become-film/,2025-04-28T12:02:43+03:00,"Book,culture","Kenyan author and Pan-African media strategist Gina Din-Kariuki’s autobiographical book, Daughter of Africa, is set to become a film following the signing of a book-to-film pipeline partnership by her American publisher. Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission. This partnership gives bold voices the platform they deserve — in print, on screen, and beyond."
Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

To mark this journey, the company has unveiled Your World of More, a special anniversary campaign dedicated to appreciating its loyal customers. Running till September 30, 2025, the Your World of More campaign is a tribute to the millions of viewers who have been part of MultiChoice’s story over the years. As part of the celebrations, MultiChoice is reaffirming its commitment to delivering diverse and premium content across DStv, Showmax, and GOtv—continuing to showcase authentic African stories that resonate with audiences. This milestone underscores the company’s dedication to shaping Kenya’s creative economy and delivering world-class entertainment to audiences.

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said.

The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."
Spotify introduces AI playlist feature to Kenyan market as part of global expansion,https://www.kbc.co.ke/spotify-introduces-ai-playlist-feature-to-kenyan-market-as-part-of-global-expansion/,2025-05-02T09:37:12+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Spotify has rolled out its AI Playlist feature to Premium users in Kenya, part of a broader expansion that includes more than 40 new markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar. Playlists can be further refined with prompts like “more upbeat” or “happier songs.” Spotify recommends using genre, mood, or artist-based prompts for the best results, but says even unconventional ideas involving emojis, movie characters or colours can be used.

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gina Din book to become film,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gina-din-book-to-become-film/,2025-04-28T12:02:43+03:00,"Book,culture","Kenyan author and Pan-African media strategist Gina Din-Kariuki’s autobiographical book, Daughter of Africa, is set to become a film following the signing of a book-to-film pipeline partnership by her American publisher. Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission. This partnership gives bold voices the platform they deserve — in print, on screen, and beyond."
Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

He further acknowledged the growth of the genre since his debut on the Coachella stage. “Coachella weekend 1 and 2 complete! I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along. Two years ago I played this same stage for less than 300 people as the opener, and this year we were 8000 people in the Yuma with a full Afro House line up nearly from open to close,” Mercier added. Aziz’s new songs in 2025 Among Kenyan Afro-house fans, Aziz is well-known for his unique ability of blending traditional African sounds with modern house, making him one of the few Kenyan Afro-house artists. His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued.

To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies.

Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar. Playlists can be further refined with prompts like “more upbeat” or “happier songs.” Spotify recommends using genre, mood, or artist-based prompts for the best results, but says even unconventional ideas involving emojis, movie characters or colours can be used.

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

Beyoncé kicks off ‘Cowboy Carter’ tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/beyonce-kicks-off-cowboy-carter-tour/,2025-04-29T07:26:16+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Beyoncé made a dramatic entrance at the kickoff of her “Cowboy Carter” tour, launching the show with “Ameriican Requiem” before delivering heartfelt renditions of her Beatles cover “Blackbiird” and the national anthem. She then turned up the energy with powerful performances of “Freedom” and “Ya Ya.” The 35-time Grammy winner took the stage in a striking all-white outfit, complete with a cowboy hat and chaps. Just before her appearance, a group of singers dressed in red set the tone by performing for the enthusiastic crowd. “Oh Beyhive, it feels so good to be on this stage,” Beyoncé said after finishing her opening number. “I want to thank all those who came before me and made it possible for me to be here today. And thank you to my fans for giving me the freedom to create this album and push myself creatively.” This concert marked the first of 32 stadium shows on her Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit Tour, which will span nine cities across the U.S. and Europe, culminating in a grand finale in Las Vegas on July 26. Beyoncé is set to break records, including the most performances at SoFi Stadium by any artist. She first announced the tour the night before the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she took home top honors: Best Country Album and Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter”. Released in March 2024, the 27-track project has since shattered records and made history as her first country album, featuring both legendary and rising Black country artists. Beyoncé previously toured in 2023 with her groundbreaking Renaissance World Tour, which launched May 10 in Stockholm and wrapped up October 1 in Kansas City after 56 shows. That tour followed the release of her seventh studio album, “Renaissance”, which earned her four Grammys, including Best Dance/Electronic Album—securing her place as the most awarded artist in Grammy history. She later revealed “Renaissance” was the first in a trilogy, with “Cowboy Carter” being its second act."
New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gina Din book to become film,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gina-din-book-to-become-film/,2025-04-28T12:02:43+03:00,"Book,culture","Kenyan author and Pan-African media strategist Gina Din-Kariuki’s autobiographical book, Daughter of Africa, is set to become a film following the signing of a book-to-film pipeline partnership by her American publisher. Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

He further acknowledged the growth of the genre since his debut on the Coachella stage. “Coachella weekend 1 and 2 complete! I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along. Two years ago I played this same stage for less than 300 people as the opener, and this year we were 8000 people in the Yuma with a full Afro House line up nearly from open to close,” Mercier added. Aziz’s new songs in 2025 Among Kenyan Afro-house fans, Aziz is well-known for his unique ability of blending traditional African sounds with modern house, making him one of the few Kenyan Afro-house artists. His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

It has shifted my focus from entertainment alone to using my art and influence to support humanitarian causes and bring solutions to the crisis of young people who are scattered all over like lost sheep without a shepherd, looking for true meaningful love and hope that only Jesus can fill the gap with.” Ole Will said Ole Willy has integrated and accepted local expressions in Rwanda, Congo, Burundi, Mozambique, as well as portions of South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, in his music and missionary activity. “The rhythms, sounds, and stories from these regions have inspired me and influenced my creativity. Their narratives of resilience and hope add depth to music and motivational speeches. However, I’m not spending much time in the studios. Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued. But his missionary work is not without its difficulties; he must deal with a number of issues, particularly the needs of displaced families in conflict areas like Congo.  In order to reflect on the culture and values of the region, Ole Willy has partnered with a number of musicians in Rwanda. He plans to work on other projects, with the specific goal of completing 200 songs by ten artists by the end of the following year. Regarding his particular message to his Kenyan supporters, Ole Willy stated, “I sincerely appreciate your support and encouragement, not only from my Kenyan fan base but from all throughout the continent. According to him, he would keep up his humanitarian efforts while inspiring, motivating, and assisting the community through his music and other talents.  “I have already established new stations in nations like Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, South Africa, Mozambique, and Eswatini.

Chefs make ‘world’s longest strawberry cake’,https://www.kbc.co.ke/chefs-make-worlds-longest-strawberry-cake/,2025-04-25T09:51:21+03:00,"Cake,culture","Armed with 4,000 eggs and a truckload of sugar and cream, French pastry chefs completed a 121.8 metre (399 feet, eight inch) long strawberry cake which they have claimed is the world’s longest ever made. Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."

Nazizi considers this release both a gift to her fans and a tribute to a cherished friend. “This one is for the fans who have held me down for 25 years, especially during my recent time of grief,” Nazizi said. “I can’t express how much your DMs, messages and encouragement have meant to me. I needed to say thank you in the only way I know how, through music. And it’s also for Hilton. He loved this song so much and kept pushing me to release it. This one’s for him too.” The music video was shot in Arusha, Tanzania by director Okey, with the dancers (Purple Dancers Crew) choreographed by Chiki and Kevo from The Dance Shagz (Kenya). The track was first performed live at Blankets & Wine in December 2024, where she asked the crowd if it should be released. Their roaring response gave her the green light.

Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity.

Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."
Marvel’s ‘Thunderbolts tops weekend Box Office,https://www.kbc.co.ke/marvels-thunderbolts-tops-weekend-box-office/,2025-05-05T09:42:14+03:00,"Box Office,Film","New Marvel superhero film “Thunderbolts” triumphed over the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million in a promising start to the summer movie season, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday. “Thunderbolts” features Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell and David Harbour as a motley bunch of antiheroes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
Brazil police foil Lady Gaga gig bomb plot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/brazil-police-foil-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot/,2025-05-04T19:09:46+03:00,"BRAZIL,Lady Gaga","Brazilian police said Sunday they had arrested two people in connection with a foiled plot to attack Lady Gaga’s packed mega-concert in Rio de Janeiro. Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue.

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said.

The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along.

His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued. But his missionary work is not without its difficulties; he must deal with a number of issues, particularly the needs of displaced families in conflict areas like Congo.  In order to reflect on the culture and values of the region, Ole Willy has partnered with a number of musicians in Rwanda. He plans to work on other projects, with the specific goal of completing 200 songs by ten artists by the end of the following year.

Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."

Dr. Billy Kahora, Project Partner and Editorial Consultant, shares that he felt energised by the submissions. “African creative non-fiction is in rude health and I just can’t wait to collaborate with these amazing writers – what was so pleasing was the variety of style and theme as warrants the idea of Citizenship on the continent.” Over the course of a 10-day intensive, fully-funded residential workshop in Accra, Ghana, the selected cohort of writers will benefit from the expertise of tutors and mentors who will support each writer in developing their proposal into full-length non-fiction pieces to be published in the Citizen anthology.

Charlene was attending the summit as a representative of the Kenyan youth. The theme for the second edition of the summit is “Building our Legacy: Sustainability, Innovation and Traditional Knowledge” which highlights Qatar’s commitment to advancing sustainability in hot and arid environments by drawing on its rich cultural heritage and unique ecosystems. Sharing this need for a return to our tradition, Charlene said that the country needed to return to those roots. “Who remembers our culture of HAKUNA MATATA (sic) ( “no trouble” “take it easy), a beautiful shared Pan-African and patriotic spirit that described our warmth, friendless, communal strength and peaceful coexistence,” she said. “The entire continent must reflect and remain intentional on how do we restore back the HAKUNA MATATA environment and move away from manufactured rage, hate, intolerance, unhealthy division, extreme radicalisation and violence.” The summit is a two-day event set to end on April 23."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.

Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar. Playlists can be further refined with prompts like “more upbeat” or “happier songs.” Spotify recommends using genre, mood, or artist-based prompts for the best results, but says even unconventional ideas involving emojis, movie characters or colours can be used.

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective.

Beyoncé kicks off ‘Cowboy Carter’ tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/beyonce-kicks-off-cowboy-carter-tour/,2025-04-29T07:26:16+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Beyoncé made a dramatic entrance at the kickoff of her “Cowboy Carter” tour, launching the show with “Ameriican Requiem” before delivering heartfelt renditions of her Beatles cover “Blackbiird” and the national anthem. She then turned up the energy with powerful performances of “Freedom” and “Ya Ya.” The 35-time Grammy winner took the stage in a striking all-white outfit, complete with a cowboy hat and chaps. Just before her appearance, a group of singers dressed in red set the tone by performing for the enthusiastic crowd. “Oh Beyhive, it feels so good to be on this stage,” Beyoncé said after finishing her opening number. “I want to thank all those who came before me and made it possible for me to be here today. And thank you to my fans for giving me the freedom to create this album and push myself creatively.” This concert marked the first of 32 stadium shows on her Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit Tour, which will span nine cities across the U.S. and Europe, culminating in a grand finale in Las Vegas on July 26. Beyoncé is set to break records, including the most performances at SoFi Stadium by any artist. She first announced the tour the night before the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she took home top honors: Best Country Album and Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter”. Released in March 2024, the 27-track project has since shattered records and made history as her first country album, featuring both legendary and rising Black country artists. Beyoncé previously toured in 2023 with her groundbreaking Renaissance World Tour, which launched May 10 in Stockholm and wrapped up October 1 in Kansas City after 56 shows. That tour followed the release of her seventh studio album, “Renaissance”, which earned her four Grammys, including Best Dance/Electronic Album—securing her place as the most awarded artist in Grammy history. She later revealed “Renaissance” was the first in a trilogy, with “Cowboy Carter” being its second act."
New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gina Din book to become film,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gina-din-book-to-become-film/,2025-04-28T12:02:43+03:00,"Book,culture","Kenyan author and Pan-African media strategist Gina Din-Kariuki’s autobiographical book, Daughter of Africa, is set to become a film following the signing of a book-to-film pipeline partnership by her American publisher. Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

He further acknowledged the growth of the genre since his debut on the Coachella stage. “Coachella weekend 1 and 2 complete! I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along. Two years ago I played this same stage for less than 300 people as the opener, and this year we were 8000 people in the Yuma with a full Afro House line up nearly from open to close,” Mercier added. Aziz’s new songs in 2025 Among Kenyan Afro-house fans, Aziz is well-known for his unique ability of blending traditional African sounds with modern house, making him one of the few Kenyan Afro-house artists. His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

It has shifted my focus from entertainment alone to using my art and influence to support humanitarian causes and bring solutions to the crisis of young people who are scattered all over like lost sheep without a shepherd, looking for true meaningful love and hope that only Jesus can fill the gap with.” Ole Will said Ole Willy has integrated and accepted local expressions in Rwanda, Congo, Burundi, Mozambique, as well as portions of South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, in his music and missionary activity. “The rhythms, sounds, and stories from these regions have inspired me and influenced my creativity. Their narratives of resilience and hope add depth to music and motivational speeches. However, I’m not spending much time in the studios. Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued. But his missionary work is not without its difficulties; he must deal with a number of issues, particularly the needs of displaced families in conflict areas like Congo.  In order to reflect on the culture and values of the region, Ole Willy has partnered with a number of musicians in Rwanda. He plans to work on other projects, with the specific goal of completing 200 songs by ten artists by the end of the following year. Regarding his particular message to his Kenyan supporters, Ole Willy stated, “I sincerely appreciate your support and encouragement, not only from my Kenyan fan base but from all throughout the continent.

Chefs make ‘world’s longest strawberry cake’,https://www.kbc.co.ke/chefs-make-worlds-longest-strawberry-cake/,2025-04-25T09:51:21+03:00,"Cake,culture","Armed with 4,000 eggs and a truckload of sugar and cream, French pastry chefs completed a 121.8 metre (399 feet, eight inch) long strawberry cake which they have claimed is the world’s longest ever made. Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."

Nazizi considers this release both a gift to her fans and a tribute to a cherished friend. “This one is for the fans who have held me down for 25 years, especially during my recent time of grief,” Nazizi said. “I can’t express how much your DMs, messages and encouragement have meant to me. I needed to say thank you in the only way I know how, through music. And it’s also for Hilton. He loved this song so much and kept pushing me to release it. This one’s for him too.” The music video was shot in Arusha, Tanzania by director Okey, with the dancers (Purple Dancers Crew) choreographed by Chiki and Kevo from The Dance Shagz (Kenya).

Speaking about his selection, Dennis Mugaa called it a “wonderful opportunity”. “Being selected for this Pfumo project means that I’ll have the requisite support and technical knowledge imparted on me to enable me to complete my writing project,” Dennis said. “It is such a wonderful opportunity that I hope to utilise to the fullest.” The collective received over 130 submissions across 37 African countries responding broadly to the question “What does it mean to be a citizen on the African continent today?” In a statement, the organisation said that they had to increase the number of participants because of the sheer number of submissions. “Getting to the final selection with such a range of strong submissions meant we increase our initial cohort number from 10 to 12, in order to accommodate the breadth of brilliance offered,” the statement read. Dr. Billy Kahora, Project Partner and Editorial Consultant, shares that he felt energised by the submissions. “African creative non-fiction is in rude health and I just can’t wait to collaborate with these amazing writers – what was so pleasing was the variety of style and theme as warrants the idea of Citizenship on the continent.” Over the course of a 10-day intensive, fully-funded residential workshop in Accra, Ghana, the selected cohort of writers will benefit from the expertise of tutors and mentors who will support each writer in developing their proposal into full-length non-fiction pieces to be published in the Citizen anthology. The inaugural cohort represents eight countries from across the African continent."

Charlene shared her excitement at having met the actor, saying she had been “starstruck”. “I admit I was a bit starstruck today meeting the legend himself @idriselba,” she said. “His one question to me was how can we amplify the stories and voices of young people?” The actor and philanthropist, known for his roles in shows like Luther and in movies like Thor, in which he played the gatekeeper Heimdall, was among the guest speakers at the summit. Mr Elba emphasised the importance of engaging young people where they are, through platforms like his new application, the Akuna Wallet, which will empower African creatives. In addition to being an all-round creative, Mr Elba is the founder of the Akuna Group, which seeks to empower young people through the creative industry, agriculture and infrastructure, which he alluded to in his question to Charlene. “I think being conscious while creating, knowing we’ll influence the next generation, is really very important. And when we think about how that connects to the climate crisis, the food crisis, we are creative human beings,” he said during his presentation. He further emphasised the importance of embracing tradition. “Let’s find different ways to innovate the traditional ways rather than doing away with them,” he added. Charlene was attending the summit as a representative of the Kenyan youth. The theme for the second edition of the summit is “Building our Legacy: Sustainability, Innovation and Traditional Knowledge” which highlights Qatar’s commitment to advancing sustainability in hot and arid environments by drawing on its rich cultural heritage and unique ecosystems. Sharing this need for a return to our tradition, Charlene said that the country needed to return to those roots. “Who remembers our culture of HAKUNA MATATA (sic) ( “no trouble” “take it easy), a beautiful shared Pan-African and patriotic spirit that described our warmth, friendless, communal strength and peaceful coexistence,” she said. “The entire continent must reflect and remain intentional on how do we restore back the HAKUNA MATATA environment and move away from manufactured rage, hate, intolerance, unhealthy division, extreme radicalisation and violence.” The summit is a two-day event set to end on April 23."

Pianist to perform London musical marathon,https://www.kbc.co.ke/pianist-to-perform-london-musical-marathon/,2025-04-23T06:03:19+03:00,"Classical Pianist,Erik Satie","Classical Russian-German pianist Igor Levit takes to a London stage this week for an epic musical endurance test directed by the world-famous Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. Levit is aiming to be the first person to solo play “Vexations”, a single sheet of music repeated 840 times, in a public performance expected to last at least 16 hours. The audience at central London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall will witness “silence, endurance, immobility and contemplation, where time ceases to exist”, according to Abramovic on the venue’s website. Written by Erik Satie in 1893, “Vexations” is described as “one of classical music’s most simple, yet arduous and demanding works”. Satie’s manuscript included a composer’s note instructing that it should be repeated 840 times, a feat which generally takes between 16-20 hours of continuous playing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Levit livestreamed a “Vexations” performance from a Berlin studio. He also streamed dozens of “concerts” from his flat in the German city to highlight the challenges faced by artists during lockdown. Although numerous pianists playing in succession have succeeded in performing “Vexations” over the years, it has rarely been completed in its entirety by a single musician. Tickets have been priced from £32 for a one hour slot with others available for the full-length performance. Levit, who is a professor at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, has released a dozen albums of classical works including Beethoven’s complete piano sonatas and concertos by Brahms. Levit told The Guardian daily he’d “never tell an audience” what they should hope to experience. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it,” he said. “It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream,” he added. Abramovic, 78, an art world icon, has earned worldwide acclaim for her work that has frequently tested her own physical and mental endurance. In one of her best known early works Rhythm O, Abramovic invited audiences to interact with her in any way they chose which resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. The “Vexations” performance will begin at 10:00am (0900GMT) on Thursday."

Like any journey, there have been challenges; Gloria Karen acknowledges the occasional negative comments and the frequent question of balancing her passions with her studies; late-night events and the financial demands of competitions also present challenges.  Despite this, she remains optimistic and grateful and offers a heartfelt recommendation to parents. “I would encourage other parents to support their kids who have talents,” expressing her gratitude. “Thanks to my parents, my dad for his monetary, psychological, and mental support all the time I have events, and my mum for always sacrificing her time to make sure I am in the event and also making sure all the attires are ready in time and also being my good manager.” She also sends a message of appreciation to her broader network of supporters. “To all those people who have tirelessly prayed and supported me, don’t get tired, and may God Almighty bless you.” Looking towards the future, Gloria Karen has a special message for the leader of her nation. “To the President of Kenya, thank you so much for recognising and appreciating talents. Supporting us young kids who have talents.” Finally, her heartfelt prayers are with her biggest champion, her father. “Finally, my prayers are to my dad, who is a PhD holder, to get a better job to always be in a position to support me fully, because some of the opportunities I miss are due to a lack of finances.” Gloria Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that passion, dedication, and a supportive community can propel even the youngest among us to achieve extraordinary things."

The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."

Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

The tool, currently in beta, allows users to generate personalised playlists using everyday language prompts. Since its initial launch last year, Spotify says the feature has been used to create millions of playlists globally. “Playlists have always been at the heart of the Spotify experience,” the streaming platform said in a statement. “AI Playlist does just that by bringing users another way to express themselves through the music they love.” The feature enables users to input prompts such as “Afrobeat tracks to heat up the dance floor” or “workout music to make my ex jealous” to receive curated song selections. It draws on users’ listening habits, favourite artists, and genre preferences to generate recommendations. To use the feature, users can tap the “+” icon in the “Your Library” section and select “AI Playlist,” or search for it through the main search bar. Playlists can be further refined with prompts like “more upbeat” or “happier songs.” Spotify recommends using genre, mood, or artist-based prompts for the best results, but says even unconventional ideas involving emojis, movie characters or colours can be used.

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

Beyoncé kicks off ‘Cowboy Carter’ tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/beyonce-kicks-off-cowboy-carter-tour/,2025-04-29T07:26:16+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Beyoncé made a dramatic entrance at the kickoff of her “Cowboy Carter” tour, launching the show with “Ameriican Requiem” before delivering heartfelt renditions of her Beatles cover “Blackbiird” and the national anthem. She then turned up the energy with powerful performances of “Freedom” and “Ya Ya.” The 35-time Grammy winner took the stage in a striking all-white outfit, complete with a cowboy hat and chaps. Just before her appearance, a group of singers dressed in red set the tone by performing for the enthusiastic crowd. “Oh Beyhive, it feels so good to be on this stage,” Beyoncé said after finishing her opening number. “I want to thank all those who came before me and made it possible for me to be here today. And thank you to my fans for giving me the freedom to create this album and push myself creatively.” This concert marked the first of 32 stadium shows on her Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit Tour, which will span nine cities across the U.S. and Europe, culminating in a grand finale in Las Vegas on July 26. Beyoncé is set to break records, including the most performances at SoFi Stadium by any artist. She first announced the tour the night before the 2025 Grammy Awards, where she took home top honors: Best Country Album and Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter”. Released in March 2024, the 27-track project has since shattered records and made history as her first country album, featuring both legendary and rising Black country artists. Beyoncé previously toured in 2023 with her groundbreaking Renaissance World Tour, which launched May 10 in Stockholm and wrapped up October 1 in Kansas City after 56 shows. That tour followed the release of her seventh studio album, “Renaissance”, which earned her four Grammys, including Best Dance/Electronic Album—securing her place as the most awarded artist in Grammy history. She later revealed “Renaissance” was the first in a trilogy, with “Cowboy Carter” being its second act."
New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gina Din book to become film,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gina-din-book-to-become-film/,2025-04-28T12:02:43+03:00,"Book,culture","Kenyan author and Pan-African media strategist Gina Din-Kariuki’s autobiographical book, Daughter of Africa, is set to become a film following the signing of a book-to-film pipeline partnership by her American publisher. Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

He further acknowledged the growth of the genre since his debut on the Coachella stage. “Coachella weekend 1 and 2 complete! I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along. Two years ago I played this same stage for less than 300 people as the opener, and this year we were 8000 people in the Yuma with a full Afro House line up nearly from open to close,” Mercier added. Aziz’s new songs in 2025 Among Kenyan Afro-house fans, Aziz is well-known for his unique ability of blending traditional African sounds with modern house, making him one of the few Kenyan Afro-house artists. His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

It has shifted my focus from entertainment alone to using my art and influence to support humanitarian causes and bring solutions to the crisis of young people who are scattered all over like lost sheep without a shepherd, looking for true meaningful love and hope that only Jesus can fill the gap with.” Ole Will said Ole Willy has integrated and accepted local expressions in Rwanda, Congo, Burundi, Mozambique, as well as portions of South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, in his music and missionary activity. “The rhythms, sounds, and stories from these regions have inspired me and influenced my creativity. Their narratives of resilience and hope add depth to music and motivational speeches. However, I’m not spending much time in the studios. Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued. But his missionary work is not without its difficulties; he must deal with a number of issues, particularly the needs of displaced families in conflict areas like Congo.  In order to reflect on the culture and values of the region, Ole Willy has partnered with a number of musicians in Rwanda. He plans to work on other projects, with the specific goal of completing 200 songs by ten artists by the end of the following year. Regarding his particular message to his Kenyan supporters, Ole Willy stated, “I sincerely appreciate your support and encouragement, not only from my Kenyan fan base but from all throughout the continent.

I want to keep growing and going. supporting programs that reduce poverty and give youth more agency.” He concluded Among the gospel hits Ole Willy has performed are Maskio ya Mungu, Moto bila moshi, Relax, Awe Nawe, and Kesho pia ni Day.

Chefs make ‘world’s longest strawberry cake’,https://www.kbc.co.ke/chefs-make-worlds-longest-strawberry-cake/,2025-04-25T09:51:21+03:00,"Cake,culture","Armed with 4,000 eggs and a truckload of sugar and cream, French pastry chefs completed a 121.8 metre (399 feet, eight inch) long strawberry cake which they have claimed is the world’s longest ever made. Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."

Nazizi considers this release both a gift to her fans and a tribute to a cherished friend. “This one is for the fans who have held me down for 25 years, especially during my recent time of grief,” Nazizi said. “I can’t express how much your DMs, messages and encouragement have meant to me. I needed to say thank you in the only way I know how, through music. And it’s also for Hilton. He loved this song so much and kept pushing me to release it. This one’s for him too.” The music video was shot in Arusha, Tanzania by director Okey, with the dancers (Purple Dancers Crew) choreographed by Chiki and Kevo from The Dance Shagz (Kenya). The track was first performed live at Blankets & Wine in December 2024, where she asked the crowd if it should be released. Their roaring response gave her the green light. Known as the First Lady of Kenyan reggae and hip hop, Nazizi taps into joy and liberation in the new release. “It’s all about releasing the stress, dancing your heart out and allowing yourself to feel good, even if just for a moment. This is my first-ever dance-based video and I am excited to see the dance challenges that come out of it.” “Gai Fafa” is a heartfelt standalone release.

Speaking to KBC Digital My Little Dancer, Managing Director, Lucy Mwai, said she wanted to offer an inclusive path to health to Kenyans. “I set up the Dance for Wellness launch to offer Kenyans a fresh, joyful, and inclusive approach to health and the healing process. With rising cases of stress, lifestyle diseases, and social disconnection, we need more than treatment, we need prevention, community, and movement.” She also wanted to make health accessible and fun. “This event is a chance to introduce a program that brings together physical fitness, emotional well-being, and creative expression in a way that’s accessible and relevant for everyday Kenyans.” The event is open to participants of all ages and backgrounds, and it promises an uplifting and energetic start to a movement that hopes to sweep across the nation. “This is not just another event—it’s a moment to reset, recharge, and reconnect.

The programme called the Citizen project will take the form of in-person workshops, mentoring and, eventually, produce an anthology of the same name. Speaking about his selection, Dennis Mugaa called it a “wonderful opportunity”. “Being selected for this Pfumo project means that I’ll have the requisite support and technical knowledge imparted on me to enable me to complete my writing project,” Dennis said. “It is such a wonderful opportunity that I hope to utilise to the fullest.” The collective received over 130 submissions across 37 African countries responding broadly to the question “What does it mean to be a citizen on the African continent today?” In a statement, the organisation said that they had to increase the number of participants because of the sheer number of submissions. “Getting to the final selection with such a range of strong submissions meant we increase our initial cohort number from 10 to 12, in order to accommodate the breadth of brilliance offered,” the statement read. Dr. Billy Kahora, Project Partner and Editorial Consultant, shares that he felt energised by the submissions. “African creative non-fiction is in rude health and I just can’t wait to collaborate with these amazing writers – what was so pleasing was the variety of style and theme as warrants the idea of Citizenship on the continent.” Over the course of a 10-day intensive, fully-funded residential workshop in Accra, Ghana, the selected cohort of writers will benefit from the expertise of tutors and mentors who will support each writer in developing their proposal into full-length non-fiction pieces to be published in the Citizen anthology. The inaugural cohort represents eight countries from across the African continent."

Charlene shared her excitement at having met the actor, saying she had been “starstruck”. “I admit I was a bit starstruck today meeting the legend himself @idriselba,” she said. “His one question to me was how can we amplify the stories and voices of young people?” The actor and philanthropist, known for his roles in shows like Luther and in movies like Thor, in which he played the gatekeeper Heimdall, was among the guest speakers at the summit. Mr Elba emphasised the importance of engaging young people where they are, through platforms like his new application, the Akuna Wallet, which will empower African creatives. In addition to being an all-round creative, Mr Elba is the founder of the Akuna Group, which seeks to empower young people through the creative industry, agriculture and infrastructure, which he alluded to in his question to Charlene. “I think being conscious while creating, knowing we’ll influence the next generation, is really very important. And when we think about how that connects to the climate crisis, the food crisis, we are creative human beings,” he said during his presentation. He further emphasised the importance of embracing tradition. “Let’s find different ways to innovate the traditional ways rather than doing away with them,” he added. Charlene was attending the summit as a representative of the Kenyan youth. The theme for the second edition of the summit is “Building our Legacy: Sustainability, Innovation and Traditional Knowledge” which highlights Qatar’s commitment to advancing sustainability in hot and arid environments by drawing on its rich cultural heritage and unique ecosystems. Sharing this need for a return to our tradition, Charlene said that the country needed to return to those roots. “Who remembers our culture of HAKUNA MATATA (sic) ( “no trouble” “take it easy), a beautiful shared Pan-African and patriotic spirit that described our warmth, friendless, communal strength and peaceful coexistence,” she said. “The entire continent must reflect and remain intentional on how do we restore back the HAKUNA MATATA environment and move away from manufactured rage, hate, intolerance, unhealthy division, extreme radicalisation and violence.” The summit is a two-day event set to end on April 23."

Pianist to perform London musical marathon,https://www.kbc.co.ke/pianist-to-perform-london-musical-marathon/,2025-04-23T06:03:19+03:00,"Classical Pianist,Erik Satie","Classical Russian-German pianist Igor Levit takes to a London stage this week for an epic musical endurance test directed by the world-famous Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. Levit is aiming to be the first person to solo play “Vexations”, a single sheet of music repeated 840 times, in a public performance expected to last at least 16 hours. The audience at central London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall will witness “silence, endurance, immobility and contemplation, where time ceases to exist”, according to Abramovic on the venue’s website. Written by Erik Satie in 1893, “Vexations” is described as “one of classical music’s most simple, yet arduous and demanding works”. Satie’s manuscript included a composer’s note instructing that it should be repeated 840 times, a feat which generally takes between 16-20 hours of continuous playing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Levit livestreamed a “Vexations” performance from a Berlin studio. He also streamed dozens of “concerts” from his flat in the German city to highlight the challenges faced by artists during lockdown. Although numerous pianists playing in succession have succeeded in performing “Vexations” over the years, it has rarely been completed in its entirety by a single musician. Tickets have been priced from £32 for a one hour slot with others available for the full-length performance. Levit, who is a professor at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, has released a dozen albums of classical works including Beethoven’s complete piano sonatas and concertos by Brahms. Levit told The Guardian daily he’d “never tell an audience” what they should hope to experience. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it,” he said. “It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream,” he added. Abramovic, 78, an art world icon, has earned worldwide acclaim for her work that has frequently tested her own physical and mental endurance. In one of her best known early works Rhythm O, Abramovic invited audiences to interact with her in any way they chose which resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. The “Vexations” performance will begin at 10:00am (0900GMT) on Thursday."

Beyond the tangible benefits, Gloria Karen emphasises the personal growth she’s experienced. “This journey has helped me gain courage and confidence,” she says despite all the ups and downs. Like any journey, there have been challenges; Gloria Karen acknowledges the occasional negative comments and the frequent question of balancing her passions with her studies; late-night events and the financial demands of competitions also present challenges.  Despite this, she remains optimistic and grateful and offers a heartfelt recommendation to parents. “I would encourage other parents to support their kids who have talents,” expressing her gratitude. “Thanks to my parents, my dad for his monetary, psychological, and mental support all the time I have events, and my mum for always sacrificing her time to make sure I am in the event and also making sure all the attires are ready in time and also being my good manager.” She also sends a message of appreciation to her broader network of supporters. “To all those people who have tirelessly prayed and supported me, don’t get tired, and may God Almighty bless you.” Looking towards the future, Gloria Karen has a special message for the leader of her nation. “To the President of Kenya, thank you so much for recognising and appreciating talents. Supporting us young kids who have talents.” Finally, her heartfelt prayers are with her biggest champion, her father. “Finally, my prayers are to my dad, who is a PhD holder, to get a better job to always be in a position to support me fully, because some of the opportunities I miss are due to a lack of finances.” Gloria Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that passion, dedication, and a supportive community can propel even the youngest among us to achieve extraordinary things."

Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan in dual roles, Sinners marks a rare victory for originality in a marketplace ruled by intellectual property. The Warner Bros. film, set in 1932 Mississippi and revolving around bootlegging brothers turned nightclub owners, edged out A Minecraft Movie, which brought in $41.3 million (KSh. 5.3B) in its third weekend. Despite Minecraft’s $720.8 million global haul to date, the fresh energy and star power of Sinners proved irresistible to U.S. and Canadian audiences over the Easter weekend. Warner Bros., which distributed both films, delivered a box office victory, though it was Sinners that stole the spotlight. The studio backed Coogler with unprecedented terms, including a share of gross profits and eventual ownership of the film after 25 years, showing deep confidence in his vision. Critics and audiences responded in kind: Sinners earned a 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an “A” CinemaScore, signalling strong word-of-mouth that could sustain its momentum. While Sinners had a softer launch internationally, $15.4 million (KSh. 1.9B)  across 71 markets, its stateside triumph stands out, especially considering Warner Bros.’ previous struggles with dual-role projects like The Alto Knights and Mickey 17."
Conclave: How a new pope is chosen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/conclave-how-a-new-pope-is-chosen/,2025-04-22T09:08:12+03:00,"Catholic Church,Conclave","Following Pope Francis’s death on Monday, cardinals will travel to the Vatican to elect his successor in a process called the conclave, which was made popular over the past year in an Oscar-winning film. Conclave, a film by Edward Berger, has earned over 100 million at the global Box Office since its release and won several awards, including a BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, A Critics’ Choice Award for Best Acting Ensemble and an Academy Award for Best Writing, to name a few. According to the film’s synopsis, Conclave follows one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events of selecting the new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence, played by Ralph Fiennes is tasked with running this covert process after the unexpected death of the beloved Pope as the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Once the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence uncovers a trail of deep secrets leading him to question the circumstances around the Pope’s death.  However, in real life, the process is slightly different. The Catholic Church enters a period known as “Sede Vacante” (Vacant See) during which a senior cardinal takes over day-to-day affairs until a new pope is elected. The cardinal, referred to as the “camerlengo” (“chamberlain”), in this case will be Irish-American Kevin Farrell, appointed to the role by Francis in February 2019. He is the only top official in the Church hierarchy to remain in post, with all others required to resign following the death of the pope. Traditionally, his main role has been to certify the death, once done by tapping the pontiff’s forehead three times with a special silver hammer and calling out his birth name. The camerlengo is also charged with destroying the “Fisherman’s Ring”, a gold signet ring specially cast for each new pope which was once used to seal documents. Originally, its destruction was to prevent forgery, but today the act, in the presence of the cardinals at their first gathering of the Sede Vacante, simply symbolises the end of a papacy. Cardinals from around the world will hold a series of meetings known as “general congregations”. They will decide on a date for the burial, which must take place between the fourth and sixth days after death, and on the organisation of the “novemdiales”, the nine days of mourning. Francis’s immediate predecessors were buried in St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, but he asked to be buried in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. His body will be placed inside a single coffin of wood and zinc, again breaking with tradition, with previous popes interred in three coffins in cypress, lead and elm, placed one inside the other. The change in funeral rituals better reflect what Francis sees as the role of the pope as “a pastor and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world”, a top official said. Francis’s open coffin will be laid out for veneration by the faithful in St Peter’s Basilica, putting an end to the display of papal bodies on a raised platform, propped up by cushions as per tradition. The general congregations are also a good way of vetting “papabili”, potential successors to Francis. The congregations will set the date for a conclave to begin no less than 15 and no more than 20 days after the death of the pope. Under a system originating in the 13th century, the conclave sees cardinals aged under 80 meet in private to choose the next pope from among their peers. Currently, there are 135 so-called “cardinal electors”, 108 of whom were appointed by Francis. Of these 53 are from Europe, 20 are from North America, 18 are from Africa, 23 from Asia, four from Oceania and 17 from South America. Conclave literally means “with a key”, reflecting the fact that the cardinals must stay until a new pope is found. Since the late 19th century, all conclaves have been held in the Sistine Chapel, a Renaissance jewel adorned with Michelangelo’s celebrated frescoes. The cardinals are sworn to absolute secrecy, under pain of excommunication during the voting.
Two ballots are held in the morning and two in the afternoon each day, until one candidate wins two-thirds of the votes.
At the end of each session, the ballots are burned in a stove by the chapel, releasing smoke above the Apostolic Palace. The smoke is black after each unsuccessful ballot, and white once the vote succeeds. The bells of St Peter’s will peal to accompany the white smoke. Once elected, the new pope will be led into a tiny sacristy by the Sistine Chapel known as the “sala delle lacrime”, or Room of Tears, where he can ponder his future. The dean of the College of Cardinals, currently Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, will ask the newly chosen pontiff if he accepts his election and what name he would like to use, and he immediately becomes the bishop of Rome and pope. The new pope is helped into his vestments (three sets are prepared, of different sizes), and one by one the cardinals pay homage to him. Shortly afterwards, he appears on the loggia of St Peter’s Basilica. The senior cardinal deacon, currently Renato Raffaele Martino, will then pronounce the famous phrase in Latin: “Habemus Papam!” (We have a pope!)."
Nigerian Afrobeat legend Femi Kuti takes a look inward,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nigerian-afrobeat-legend-femi-kuti-takes-a-look-inward/,2025-04-21T09:03:13+03:00,"Afrobeat,Eedris Abdulkareem","Sat comfortably in a large chair at the New Afrika Shrine, his family’s legendary Nigerian music venue, Femi Kuti was surrounded by history. The concert hall is an homage to his father Fela Kuti’s original Shrine, which had also been located in the northern outskirts of Lagos before its demise. Femi’s own music awards are scattered around, recognition for his determination to keep fighting the good fight his Afrobeat legend father was known for — calling out corruption and injustice in Africa’s most populous nation. Part of a family defined by its determination to speak defiantly about what was going on around them — whether through lyrics or protest or both — Femi Kuti, however, is ready to turn inward, and focus on the “virtues that have guided me in my life”, he told AFP in a recent interview. Those reflections will be apparent in the 62-year-old’s upcoming album, “Journey Through Life,” his 13th record, set to release on April 25. In the upcoming record, he sings about “the kind of advice I give myself to where I am today,” he said. The title track, for example, is “not political”. But listeners should not expect a member of the Kuti clan to give up politics completely. – From Afrobeat to Afrobeats –
The elder Kuti came to define Afrobeat, the 70s-era jazz- and funk-inspired genre that would later give birth to the modern, R&B-inspired Afrobeats — plural — style shaking up the global music industry today. He was also a poster child of protest — using his lyrics to call out government abuses, even under brutal military juntas that ran Nigeria off and on before its latest transition to democracy in 1999, two years after his death from AIDS. Femi Kuti’s grandmother, meanwhile, was a women’s rights and independence activist. It might be a given, then, that the virtues that guided Femi Kuti would be political in nature — though he has tempered his expectations of what exactly music can do. “My father used to say music is the weapon. I think music is a weapon for change, but it can’t be the soul,” he said. “We still need organisations.” After all, the elder Kuti was repeatedly beaten and jailed by authorities — and with an incomplete record to show for it. Democracy might have eventually taken hold, but the corruption he railed against has been trickier to uproot. “Self-reflection makes me think maybe it’s not possible to change the world. But one thing I’m sure of is that I can change myself, I can make myself a better person,” Kuti told AFP. – New songs, same struggles –
Femi Kuti has spent the last four decades as the heir to his father’s activism and musical style. Together with his son Made and brother Seun, he keeps the New Afrika Shrine a sweaty, bumping place to be each Sunday night, and continues to tour internationally. The album, Kuti promised, is “still very political” — and Kuti has some of his own thoughts to share as well. “I’ve been singing political songs for 38 years,” yet not much has changed. In “Nigeria, it’s gotten worse”. “Corruption must stop in the political class,” he said. “Everybody thinks the only way to be successful is through corruption.” “The health care — there’s nothing that works,” he said. “We can’t afford a good education (for children).” These days he is unlikely to be beaten or jailed like his father — which traumatised his family growing up, he said. Though things are not always rosy for musicians in the modern political climate either. Broadcasting authorities earlier this month banned “Tell Your Papa”, by Eedris Abdulkareem, for its lyrics blasting President Bola Tinubu’s handling of the economic and security situation in the country. The government is pursuing painful — though necessary, it argues — economic reforms, while insecurity from jihadist groups continues to menace the country’s north. “It will probably be very hard for me to not talk on political subjects,” Kuti admitted, before an electrifying live performance at an all-night show. “I’ve lived it all my life with my father”"
‘Grandpa robbers’ go on trial for Kim Kardashian heist in Paris,https://www.kbc.co.ke/grandpa-robbers-go-on-trial-for-kardashian-heist-in-paris/,2025-04-21T07:48:19+03:00,"Aomar Ait Khedache,France","A group of suspects nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” goes on trial at the end of April, charged with stealing jewellery worth millions from US reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. In what the French press has called “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the luxury Parisian hotel where Kardashian was staying in October 2016 with millions of dollars worth of jewels, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. Kardashian will testify in person at the trial, which opens on April 28, her US lawyer Michael Rhodes said last week. Ten people will be in the dock and the verdict is expected on May 23, with Kardashian set to appear on May 13, according to a provisional schedule. In what has been called the biggest French hold-up targeting an individual in 20 years, Kardashian was robbed of jewellery estimated at 10 million euros ($11.4 million at current rates) while she was staying at a luxury residence during Paris fashion week. Among the suspects arrested four months later in Paris and in the south of France is Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68, who has admitted to his participation in the heist, but denies the prosecution’s accusation that he was also the ringleader. Two investigating magistrates ordered the suspects to stand trial by jury — which in France is reserved for the most serious crimes — on charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and membership of a criminal gang. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, several men, some impersonating police officers, entered the hotel where Kardashian, who was then 35, was staying during Fashion Week. The star had attended a Givenchy show before returning to the hotel around midnight without her bodyguard who was with her sister Kourtney, also a media personality and socialite, who had gone clubbing. – An ‘easy’ heist –
Two of the intruders put guns to her head and one, Kardashian later told detectives, addressed her “with a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. That ring from West, which the influencer had shown off extensively on social media, was estimated to be worth four million dollars. The intruders then tied her up, gagged her and carried her into the bathroom. Three men meanwhile kept watch at the reception, with one waiting at the wheel of a getaway car. The entire robbery lasted around 10 minutes. Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. Ait Khedache later told investigators that the job had been “easy”, and nothing like a regular armed robbery. In addition to the ring, which featured a near-flawless 18.88-carat diamond, the group made off with several more pieces of gold and diamond jewellery, including a gold Rolex watch. One of the alleged robbers, Yunice Abbas, now 71, fleeing the scene on a bicycle, dropped a diamond-encrusted cross worth 30,000 euros, which was found by a passer-by a few hours later. The suspected thieves lost a few more items while on the run, but the bulk of the bounty has never been found and is believed to have been sold in Belgium. Abbas later wrote a book, called “I kidnapped Kim Kardashian”, despite also claiming that he was just one of the lookouts without laying eyes on the star. Another suspect, 69-year-old Didier Dubreucq, also came to the scene by bike and is accused of having been in Kardashian’s room, which he denies. The ageing suspects had, according to prosecutors, hoped to make a criminal comeback with the heist. The suspects were identified mostly thanks to their DNA. Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another, 80-year-old Pierre Bouianere, was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately."
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."
Marvel’s ‘Thunderbolts tops weekend Box Office,https://www.kbc.co.ke/marvels-thunderbolts-tops-weekend-box-office/,2025-05-05T09:42:14+03:00,"Box Office,Film","New Marvel superhero film “Thunderbolts” triumphed over the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million in a promising start to the summer movie season, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday. “Thunderbolts” features Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell and David Harbour as a motley bunch of antiheroes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a malevolent CIA chief. “This is a very good opening for a new superhero story,” said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. With “excellent” reviews and audience scores, the film should “play extremely well around the world,” he said. Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian said on X that “this kickoff film of the summer movie season will ignite an epic month of May for movie theatres!” Ryan Coogler’s period vampire thriller “Sinners” starring Michael B. Jordan slipped to second place but still took in $33 million in its third weekend out, a showing The Hollywood Reporter called “phenomenal.” Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, rose one spot from last weekend to third, earning $13.7 million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. It remains the top release of the year, with total US ticket sales of $398.2 million and international sales of $475 million for a total of $873.2 million. Fourth place went to Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Accountant 2,” at $9.5 million. Ben Affleck plays a neurodivergent math genius with criminal ties, and Jon Bernthal is his hit-man brother. And in fifth was another video game adaptation, Sony’s gory horror film “Until Dawn,” at $3.8 million. Meantime, Alec Baldwin’s ill-fated Western “Rust”, made infamous when a weapon held by Baldwin discharged a bullet, fatally wounding the film’s cinematographer, finally opened in a limited release of 115 theatres. It took in just $25,000, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
Brazil police foil Lady Gaga gig bomb plot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/brazil-police-foil-lady-gaga-gig-bomb-plot/,2025-05-04T19:09:46+03:00,"BRAZIL,Lady Gaga","Brazilian police said Sunday they had arrested two people in connection with a foiled plot to attack Lady Gaga’s packed mega-concert in Rio de Janeiro. Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice” it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night. Officials said the superstar’s free gig on the beach drew up to two million people. Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said.

The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

I’m grateful for how much this Afro House sound has grown and how far I’ve come along.

His hit singles include “Come dada” and “Kiswahili”. Beyond performing at Coachella, Aziz has released a number of new songs this year, like “Tabia”, released in March as a tribute to his fans. “This month of Ramadan has always been a blessing for me, as I believe it is for all my Muslim brothers and sisters,” he said at the time. “As we approach the end of this holy month, I wanted to give my fans a special gift—a new rendition of one of my old tracks as a token of appreciation. ‘Tabia’ goes way back to my Afro-fusion days, and now, I’ve given it a new Afro-house groove.” Aziz has also released a new version of “No Letting Go” alongside Klement Bonneli."

Instead I connect young people from African countries to come together and build African sound art. And we use the sounds for evangelism on our missions. We have projects going on.” He continued. But his missionary work is not without its difficulties; he must deal with a number of issues, particularly the needs of displaced families in conflict areas like Congo.

He plans to work on other projects, with the specific goal of completing 200 songs by ten artists by the end of the following year.

Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP. Residents of Argenteuil who went to see the calorie packed record-breaker on Wednesday were given a piece to take away."

Dr. Billy Kahora, Project Partner and Editorial Consultant, shares that he felt energised by the submissions. “African creative non-fiction is in rude health and I just can’t wait to collaborate with these amazing writers – what was so pleasing was the variety of style and theme as warrants the idea of Citizenship on the continent.” Over the course of a 10-day intensive, fully-funded residential workshop in Accra, Ghana, the selected cohort of writers will benefit from the expertise of tutors and mentors who will support each writer in developing their proposal into full-length non-fiction pieces to be published in the Citizen anthology. The inaugural cohort represents eight countries from across the African continent."

In addition to being an all-round creative, Mr Elba is the founder of the Akuna Group, which seeks to empower young people through the creative industry, agriculture and infrastructure, which he alluded to in his question to Charlene. “I think being conscious while creating, knowing we’ll influence the next generation, is really very important. And when we think about how that connects to the climate crisis, the food crisis, we are creative human beings,” he said during his presentation. He further emphasised the importance of embracing tradition. “Let’s find different ways to innovate the traditional ways rather than doing away with them,” he added. Charlene was attending the summit as a representative of the Kenyan youth. The theme for the second edition of the summit is “Building our Legacy: Sustainability, Innovation and Traditional Knowledge” which highlights Qatar’s commitment to advancing sustainability in hot and arid environments by drawing on its rich cultural heritage and unique ecosystems. Sharing this need for a return to our tradition, Charlene said that the country needed to return to those roots. “Who remembers our culture of HAKUNA MATATA (sic) ( “no trouble” “take it easy), a beautiful shared Pan-African and patriotic spirit that described our warmth, friendless, communal strength and peaceful coexistence,” she said. “The entire continent must reflect and remain intentional on how do we restore back the HAKUNA MATATA environment and move away from manufactured rage, hate, intolerance, unhealthy division, extreme radicalisation and violence.” The summit is a two-day event set to end on April 23."

Pianist to perform London musical marathon,https://www.kbc.co.ke/pianist-to-perform-london-musical-marathon/,2025-04-23T06:03:19+03:00,"Classical Pianist,Erik Satie","Classical Russian-German pianist Igor Levit takes to a London stage this week for an epic musical endurance test directed by the world-famous Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. Levit is aiming to be the first person to solo play “Vexations”, a single sheet of music repeated 840 times, in a public performance expected to last at least 16 hours. The audience at central London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall will witness “silence, endurance, immobility and contemplation, where time ceases to exist”, according to Abramovic on the venue’s website. Written by Erik Satie in 1893, “Vexations” is described as “one of classical music’s most simple, yet arduous and demanding works”. Satie’s manuscript included a composer’s note instructing that it should be repeated 840 times, a feat which generally takes between 16-20 hours of continuous playing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Levit livestreamed a “Vexations” performance from a Berlin studio. He also streamed dozens of “concerts” from his flat in the German city to highlight the challenges faced by artists during lockdown. Although numerous pianists playing in succession have succeeded in performing “Vexations” over the years, it has rarely been completed in its entirety by a single musician. Tickets have been priced from £32 for a one hour slot with others available for the full-length performance. Levit, who is a professor at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, has released a dozen albums of classical works including Beethoven’s complete piano sonatas and concertos by Brahms. Levit told The Guardian daily he’d “never tell an audience” what they should hope to experience. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it,” he said. “It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream,” he added. Abramovic, 78, an art world icon, has earned worldwide acclaim for her work that has frequently tested her own physical and mental endurance. In one of her best known early works Rhythm O, Abramovic invited audiences to interact with her in any way they chose which resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. The “Vexations” performance will begin at 10:00am (0900GMT) on Thursday."

With a vibrant spirit and a heart full of dreams, she’s carving a remarkable path in the worlds of modelling, singing, and acting. This young talent has already amassed an impressive list of achievements, proving that age is no barrier to pursuing your passions. Her journey into the spotlight has seen her crowned 2nd Princess Miss Kenya, Preteen Miss Fashionista, and Pre-teen Miss Kenya Muranga County. She also walked away with the title of Best Casual Wear Little Miss Kenya and secured an impressive 1st runner-up position at Miss Africa. In 2024, adding to her accolades, Gloria Karen was recognised as the Kids Influencer of the Year at the 2024 Miss Independent Kenya Awards. Now, this bright star is set to shine even brighter. Due to her consistent achievements, Gloria Karen has been selected to represent Kenya as a finalist in the prestigious Little Miss Universe competition set to take place in May in India.  It’s a testament to her unwavering belief in turning dreams into tangible goals. “It has been a long journey with ups and downs,” Gloria Karen shares, her youthful voice filled with a wisdom beyond her years, “but the focus is always on positive things.” This journey has brought incredible advantages to Gloria Karen’s life. It’s opening doors to the international modelling scene and providing platforms to connect with influential figures in Kenya, from beloved celebrities to respected politicians. More importantly, her platform has allowed her to give back in a meaningful way. “Through this journey, I was able to open my foundation,” she explains with pride. This foundation is dedicated to a range of compassionate initiatives, including feeding street children, supporting needy families, visiting the elderly, and bringing cheer to sick children in hospitals, especially those with cleft lip and palate. The exposure has also fostered a strong sense of community around her. “Through this platform, people get to know me, and I get a lot of support when I have an event and help in terms of money and physical items like clothing and foodstuffs,” she says. Beyond the tangible benefits, Gloria Karen emphasises the personal growth she’s experienced. “This journey has helped me gain courage and confidence,” she says despite all the ups and downs. Like any journey, there have been challenges; Gloria Karen acknowledges the occasional negative comments and the frequent question of balancing her passions with her studies; late-night events and the financial demands of competitions also present challenges.  Despite this, she remains optimistic and grateful and offers a heartfelt recommendation to parents. “I would encourage other parents to support their kids who have talents,” expressing her gratitude. “Thanks to my parents, my dad for his monetary, psychological, and mental support all the time I have events, and my mum for always sacrificing her time to make sure I am in the event and also making sure all the attires are ready in time and also being my good manager.” She also sends a message of appreciation to her broader network of supporters. “To all those people who have tirelessly prayed and supported me, don’t get tired, and may God Almighty bless you.” Looking towards the future, Gloria Karen has a special message for the leader of her nation. “To the President of Kenya, thank you so much for recognising and appreciating talents. Supporting us young kids who have talents.” Finally, her heartfelt prayers are with her biggest champion, her father. “Finally, my prayers are to my dad, who is a PhD holder, to get a better job to always be in a position to support me fully, because some of the opportunities I miss are due to a lack of finances.” Gloria Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that passion, dedication, and a supportive community can propel even the youngest among us to achieve extraordinary things."

‘Sinners’ surpasses ‘Minecraft’ at Box Office in first outing,https://www.kbc.co.ke/sinners-surpasses-minecraft-at-box-office-in-first-outing/,2025-04-22T09:41:59+03:00,"Entertainment,International","Sinners, an original, blood-soaked vampire tale, has defied expectations and risen to the top of the box office, overtaking A Minecraft Movie with a $45.6 million (KSh. 5.9B) debut. Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan in dual roles, Sinners marks a rare victory for originality in a marketplace ruled by intellectual property. The Warner Bros. film, set in 1932 Mississippi and revolving around bootlegging brothers turned nightclub owners, edged out A Minecraft Movie, which brought in $41.3 million (KSh. 5.3B) in its third weekend. Despite Minecraft’s $720.8 million global haul to date, the fresh energy and star power of Sinners proved irresistible to U.S. and Canadian audiences over the Easter weekend. Warner Bros., which distributed both films, delivered a box office victory, though it was Sinners that stole the spotlight. The studio backed Coogler with unprecedented terms, including a share of gross profits and eventual ownership of the film after 25 years, showing deep confidence in his vision. Critics and audiences responded in kind: Sinners earned a 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an “A” CinemaScore, signalling strong word-of-mouth that could sustain its momentum. While Sinners had a softer launch internationally, $15.4 million (KSh. 1.9B)  across 71 markets, its stateside triumph stands out, especially considering Warner Bros.’ previous struggles with dual-role projects like The Alto Knights and Mickey 17."
Conclave: How a new pope is chosen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/conclave-how-a-new-pope-is-chosen/,2025-04-22T09:08:12+03:00,"Catholic Church,Conclave","Following Pope Francis’s death on Monday, cardinals will travel to the Vatican to elect his successor in a process called the conclave, which was made popular over the past year in an Oscar-winning film. Conclave, a film by Edward Berger, has earned over 100 million at the global Box Office since its release and won several awards, including a BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, A Critics’ Choice Award for Best Acting Ensemble and an Academy Award for Best Writing, to name a few. According to the film’s synopsis, Conclave follows one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events of selecting the new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence, played by Ralph Fiennes is tasked with running this covert process after the unexpected death of the beloved Pope as the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Once the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence uncovers a trail of deep secrets leading him to question the circumstances around the Pope’s death.  However, in real life, the process is slightly different. The Catholic Church enters a period known as “Sede Vacante” (Vacant See) during which a senior cardinal takes over day-to-day affairs until a new pope is elected. The cardinal, referred to as the “camerlengo” (“chamberlain”), in this case will be Irish-American Kevin Farrell, appointed to the role by Francis in February 2019. He is the only top official in the Church hierarchy to remain in post, with all others required to resign following the death of the pope. Traditionally, his main role has been to certify the death, once done by tapping the pontiff’s forehead three times with a special silver hammer and calling out his birth name. The camerlengo is also charged with destroying the “Fisherman’s Ring”, a gold signet ring specially cast for each new pope which was once used to seal documents. Originally, its destruction was to prevent forgery, but today the act, in the presence of the cardinals at their first gathering of the Sede Vacante, simply symbolises the end of a papacy. Cardinals from around the world will hold a series of meetings known as “general congregations”. They will decide on a date for the burial, which must take place between the fourth and sixth days after death, and on the organisation of the “novemdiales”, the nine days of mourning. Francis’s immediate predecessors were buried in St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, but he asked to be buried in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. His body will be placed inside a single coffin of wood and zinc, again breaking with tradition, with previous popes interred in three coffins in cypress, lead and elm, placed one inside the other. The change in funeral rituals better reflect what Francis sees as the role of the pope as “a pastor and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world”, a top official said. Francis’s open coffin will be laid out for veneration by the faithful in St Peter’s Basilica, putting an end to the display of papal bodies on a raised platform, propped up by cushions as per tradition. The general congregations are also a good way of vetting “papabili”, potential successors to Francis. The congregations will set the date for a conclave to begin no less than 15 and no more than 20 days after the death of the pope. Under a system originating in the 13th century, the conclave sees cardinals aged under 80 meet in private to choose the next pope from among their peers. Currently, there are 135 so-called “cardinal electors”, 108 of whom were appointed by Francis. Of these 53 are from Europe, 20 are from North America, 18 are from Africa, 23 from Asia, four from Oceania and 17 from South America. Conclave literally means “with a key”, reflecting the fact that the cardinals must stay until a new pope is found. Since the late 19th century, all conclaves have been held in the Sistine Chapel, a Renaissance jewel adorned with Michelangelo’s celebrated frescoes. The cardinals are sworn to absolute secrecy, under pain of excommunication during the voting.
Two ballots are held in the morning and two in the afternoon each day, until one candidate wins two-thirds of the votes.
At the end of each session, the ballots are burned in a stove by the chapel, releasing smoke above the Apostolic Palace. The smoke is black after each unsuccessful ballot, and white once the vote succeeds. The bells of St Peter’s will peal to accompany the white smoke. Once elected, the new pope will be led into a tiny sacristy by the Sistine Chapel known as the “sala delle lacrime”, or Room of Tears, where he can ponder his future. The dean of the College of Cardinals, currently Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, will ask the newly chosen pontiff if he accepts his election and what name he would like to use, and he immediately becomes the bishop of Rome and pope. The new pope is helped into his vestments (three sets are prepared, of different sizes), and one by one the cardinals pay homage to him. Shortly afterwards, he appears on the loggia of St Peter’s Basilica. The senior cardinal deacon, currently Renato Raffaele Martino, will then pronounce the famous phrase in Latin: “Habemus Papam!” (We have a pope!)."
Nigerian Afrobeat legend Femi Kuti takes a look inward,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nigerian-afrobeat-legend-femi-kuti-takes-a-look-inward/,2025-04-21T09:03:13+03:00,"Afrobeat,Eedris Abdulkareem","Sat comfortably in a large chair at the New Afrika Shrine, his family’s legendary Nigerian music venue, Femi Kuti was surrounded by history. The concert hall is an homage to his father Fela Kuti’s original Shrine, which had also been located in the northern outskirts of Lagos before its demise. Femi’s own music awards are scattered around, recognition for his determination to keep fighting the good fight his Afrobeat legend father was known for — calling out corruption and injustice in Africa’s most populous nation. Part of a family defined by its determination to speak defiantly about what was going on around them — whether through lyrics or protest or both — Femi Kuti, however, is ready to turn inward, and focus on the “virtues that have guided me in my life”, he told AFP in a recent interview. Those reflections will be apparent in the 62-year-old’s upcoming album, “Journey Through Life,” his 13th record, set to release on April 25. In the upcoming record, he sings about “the kind of advice I give myself to where I am today,” he said. The title track, for example, is “not political”. But listeners should not expect a member of the Kuti clan to give up politics completely. – From Afrobeat to Afrobeats –
The elder Kuti came to define Afrobeat, the 70s-era jazz- and funk-inspired genre that would later give birth to the modern, R&B-inspired Afrobeats — plural — style shaking up the global music industry today. He was also a poster child of protest — using his lyrics to call out government abuses, even under brutal military juntas that ran Nigeria off and on before its latest transition to democracy in 1999, two years after his death from AIDS. Femi Kuti’s grandmother, meanwhile, was a women’s rights and independence activist. It might be a given, then, that the virtues that guided Femi Kuti would be political in nature — though he has tempered his expectations of what exactly music can do. “My father used to say music is the weapon. I think music is a weapon for change, but it can’t be the soul,” he said. “We still need organisations.” After all, the elder Kuti was repeatedly beaten and jailed by authorities — and with an incomplete record to show for it. Democracy might have eventually taken hold, but the corruption he railed against has been trickier to uproot. “Self-reflection makes me think maybe it’s not possible to change the world. But one thing I’m sure of is that I can change myself, I can make myself a better person,” Kuti told AFP. – New songs, same struggles –
Femi Kuti has spent the last four decades as the heir to his father’s activism and musical style. Together with his son Made and brother Seun, he keeps the New Afrika Shrine a sweaty, bumping place to be each Sunday night, and continues to tour internationally. The album, Kuti promised, is “still very political” — and Kuti has some of his own thoughts to share as well. “I’ve been singing political songs for 38 years,” yet not much has changed. In “Nigeria, it’s gotten worse”. “Corruption must stop in the political class,” he said. “Everybody thinks the only way to be successful is through corruption.” “The health care — there’s nothing that works,” he said. “We can’t afford a good education (for children).” These days he is unlikely to be beaten or jailed like his father — which traumatised his family growing up, he said. Though things are not always rosy for musicians in the modern political climate either. Broadcasting authorities earlier this month banned “Tell Your Papa”, by Eedris Abdulkareem, for its lyrics blasting President Bola Tinubu’s handling of the economic and security situation in the country. The government is pursuing painful — though necessary, it argues — economic reforms, while insecurity from jihadist groups continues to menace the country’s north. “It will probably be very hard for me to not talk on political subjects,” Kuti admitted, before an electrifying live performance at an all-night show. “I’ve lived it all my life with my father”"
‘Grandpa robbers’ go on trial for Kim Kardashian heist in Paris,https://www.kbc.co.ke/grandpa-robbers-go-on-trial-for-kardashian-heist-in-paris/,2025-04-21T07:48:19+03:00,"Aomar Ait Khedache,France","A group of suspects nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” goes on trial at the end of April, charged with stealing jewellery worth millions from US reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. In what the French press has called “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the luxury Parisian hotel where Kardashian was staying in October 2016 with millions of dollars worth of jewels, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. Kardashian will testify in person at the trial, which opens on April 28, her US lawyer Michael Rhodes said last week. Ten people will be in the dock and the verdict is expected on May 23, with Kardashian set to appear on May 13, according to a provisional schedule. In what has been called the biggest French hold-up targeting an individual in 20 years, Kardashian was robbed of jewellery estimated at 10 million euros ($11.4 million at current rates) while she was staying at a luxury residence during Paris fashion week. Among the suspects arrested four months later in Paris and in the south of France is Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68, who has admitted to his participation in the heist, but denies the prosecution’s accusation that he was also the ringleader. Two investigating magistrates ordered the suspects to stand trial by jury — which in France is reserved for the most serious crimes — on charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and membership of a criminal gang. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, several men, some impersonating police officers, entered the hotel where Kardashian, who was then 35, was staying during Fashion Week. The star had attended a Givenchy show before returning to the hotel around midnight without her bodyguard who was with her sister Kourtney, also a media personality and socialite, who had gone clubbing. – An ‘easy’ heist –
Two of the intruders put guns to her head and one, Kardashian later told detectives, addressed her “with a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. That ring from West, which the influencer had shown off extensively on social media, was estimated to be worth four million dollars. The intruders then tied her up, gagged her and carried her into the bathroom. Three men meanwhile kept watch at the reception, with one waiting at the wheel of a getaway car. The entire robbery lasted around 10 minutes. Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. Ait Khedache later told investigators that the job had been “easy”, and nothing like a regular armed robbery. In addition to the ring, which featured a near-flawless 18.88-carat diamond, the group made off with several more pieces of gold and diamond jewellery, including a gold Rolex watch. One of the alleged robbers, Yunice Abbas, now 71, fleeing the scene on a bicycle, dropped a diamond-encrusted cross worth 30,000 euros, which was found by a passer-by a few hours later. The suspected thieves lost a few more items while on the run, but the bulk of the bounty has never been found and is believed to have been sold in Belgium. Abbas later wrote a book, called “I kidnapped Kim Kardashian”, despite also claiming that he was just one of the lookouts without laying eyes on the star. Another suspect, 69-year-old Didier Dubreucq, also came to the scene by bike and is accused of having been in Kardashian’s room, which he denies. The ageing suspects had, according to prosecutors, hoped to make a criminal comeback with the heist. The suspects were identified mostly thanks to their DNA. Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another, 80-year-old Pierre Bouianere, was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately."
Right bookstore in right place — the success story of Waterstones,https://www.kbc.co.ke/right-bookstore-in-right-place-the-success-story-of-waterstones/,2025-04-19T09:53:55+03:00,"Books,bookstores","From high-end urban streets to picturesque suburbs, Waterstones stands as one of Britain’s most iconic bookstore brands. Yet only a decade ago, it was on the brink of bankruptcy, squeezed by the menacing rise of e-reading. Its revival is largely credited to one man who remains steadfast in his mantra — placing the right bookstore in the right place. As both the managing director of Waterstones and CEO of Barnes & Noble in the United States, two major bookstore chains on two continents, James Daunt is a man of deep conviction when it comes to physical bookstores. “Bookstores are for everyone,” he said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at Waterstones’ flagship store on London’s Piccadilly on Thursday. “That’s an incredible strength as a retailer — you appeal to everyone, not just to women, not just to men, not just to young, not just to old. It’s a place to come to for pleasure.” Daunt left a career at J.P. Morgan to open his first bookstore on London’s Marylebone High Street in 1990. That original Daunt Books location has since become one of the city’s most beloved places for book lovers — now also a popular spot among Chinese visitors inspired by posts on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu, or “rednote.” In 2011, Daunt brought that same independent spirit to Waterstones at a time when digital readers like Amazon’s Kindle were poised to render traditional bookstores obsolete. One of his first acts was to prove that wrong. With a belief that each store should reflect its own character, Daunt delegated more autonomy to store managers, scrapping the same layouts and promotional plans and allowing individual shops to decide which books to stock and how to display them. “We empower our booksellers, each store, to do whatever is sensible for its location,” Daunt explained. “It’s the vocational commitment to good bookselling that’s allowing us to run these wonderful stores.” Another major shift came when Daunt ended the longstanding practice of publishers paying for guaranteed shelf placement — a model that often resulted in unsold and returned stock. Instead, Waterstones handed the decision back to its booksellers and their customers. By 2023, only about 9 percent of books were being returned to publishers, down dramatically from 30 to 40 percent in previous years. Barnes & Noble has since adopted similar reforms. After weathering the disruption of e-readers, bookstores today face a new challenge: distraction from social media. Still, Daunt remains optimistic. “When I grew up, we were told we’d never read again because all we would do is watch television, and it was making our eyes ‘square,'” he said. “Now we’re applying that same narrative to the iPad, the iPhone, social media. But we now have more bookstores than we ever had — publishers are publishing more.” He gestured to the headquarters of major publishers near the Thames. “You walk into a gleaming marble building, the most expensive offices in London. Is that because nobody’s reading anymore? No. More and more people are reading with every passing year.” Books, Daunt argued, remain central to culture, which is fueling creativity, shaping movies and ideas, and thriving through new forms of engagement. “When I started, we used to have bestsellers once or twice a year. Now it’s once a month, once a week. But I’m always told nobody’s reading anymore.” “TikTok has been an astonishing medium to convey the energy and experience of our stores,” he said. “These young kids have done that brilliantly. We’ve become a venue for the social media encouragement of reading. It’s propelled bestsellers in a way almost nothing else has done.” For Daunt, bookstores are always a place in everyone’s childhood memory. “When you’re in your twenties, it’s part of courtship — ‘What are you reading?’ ‘What am I reading?’ — It’s a physical space in which it’s just lovely to be.” “If you put really good bookstores in front of people, they will buy more books. You’ll see more people reading on the Tube, on the train, in the bus — wherever it might be.” Looking abroad, Daunt recently visited Chengdu, capital of southwest China’s Sichuan Province, and found fresh inspiration. “The physical spaces, the architecture, the design, the presentation, and the fluidity with which it was being done were exceptional,” he said. “We borrowed quite a lot of those things and use them today in Waterstones.” “Remember, not long ago, everyone said it was only going to be e-reading. No physical books. Too heavy to carry. But once we got our energy back and our confidence back, we started selling lots more.”"

Celebrating Easter and its various traditions,https://www.kbc.co.ke/celebrating-easter-and-its-various-traditions/,2025-04-18T10:39:09+03:00,"culture,Easter","Christianity and Good Friday Good Friday is a significant day of observance for Christians around the world as it marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. On this day, Christians commemorate the death of Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to save humanity from sin and reconcile them with God. For Christians, Good Friday is a day of solemn reflection and repentance, as they remember the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It is a day to meditate on the immense love and mercy of God for sending his only Son to die for the sins of humanity. The Way of the Cross For the Catholic Church, it is the day when popular activities such as The Way of the Cross take place. Good Friday is a part of the Holy Week, which begins with Palm Sunday, followed by Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and culminates in Easter Sunday, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Way of the Cross, also known as the Stations of the Cross, is a traditional Catholic devotion that commemorates the events leading up to and including the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The devotion consists of 14 stations, each representing a different event or moment in the story of Jesus’ journey to his death on the cross. The stations typically include: Jesus is condemned to death
Jesus takes up his cross
Jesus falls for the first time
Jesus meets his mother, Mary
Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross
Veronica wipes the face of Jesus
Jesus falls for the second time
Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
Jesus falls for the third time
Jesus is stripped of his garments
Jesus is nailed to the cross
Jesus dies on the cross
Jesus is taken down from the cross
Jesus is placed in the tomb The Way of the Cross is typically prayed during the season of Lent, especially on Fridays, and is often used as a way to reflect on the sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. It is a solemn and contemplative devotion that can help deepen one’s understanding and appreciation of the Christian faith. The Easter Bunny Away from Christianity, in countries like the United States and countries in Europe like Germany, Easter, as a whole and not just Good Friday, comes with a different celebration; the Easter Bunny. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, the Easter bunny is a celebrated character in Western Easter celebrations. On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind. The mythical figure, the hare, is rooted in European prehistoric, Pagan and Greek traditions. Spending time with family For most Kenyans, however, it is also a day to spend time with family, either by travelling upcountry, enjoying a holiday away from home or at home. If you intend to visit any of Kenya’s national parks this long weekend, the Kenya Wildlife Service has advised that bookings be made early as they roll-out the “Easter Moto Moto in Kenya Parks” campaign. Happy Easter!"
Mulatu Astatke: long journey for the ‘father of Ethio-jazz’,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mulatu-astatke-long-journey-for-the-father-of-ethio-jazz/,2025-04-18T08:32:05+03:00,"Ethio-Jazz,ETHIOPIA","Mulatu Astatke struggled for decades before his name became associated worldwide with a musical genre and he was finally born as the father of Ethio-jazz. Now despite that long journey and his 81 years of age, the Ethiopian music legend cannot even “think about retirement”. A one-man band, equally at home with the vibraphone and the conga, a Cuban drum, he created a unique musical blend in the 1960s, a mix of traditional Ethiopian music, funk brass, Afro-beat, and Latin jazz. “Ethio-jazz is a musical genre which puts the whole world together and makes them one,” the octogenarian with a salt-and-pepper moustache told AFP in a recent interview. The masenqo, a traditional Ethiopian single-stringed instrument played with a bow, features alongside the guitar and the trumpet in his performances. “This is what I want to do, bring the world together around music,” said the composer and trained percussionist in a low voice inside his jazz club African Jazz Village, where he still performs near Addis Ababa’s famous Meskel Square. His music is intended to pay homage to those he calls the “bush people”, the rural Ethiopian populations whose dance and music have had a considerable influence on his work and who, according to him, are “not recognized enough”. “The people who invented the masenqo, those who invented the krar (an Ethiopian stringed instrument similar to the lyre), they are the ones who invented Mulatu,” he said. “Tezeta” — “nostalgia” in Amharic, the Ethiopian national language — is one of the composer’s best-known songs, a sensual and catchy ballad where the saxophone and piano echo each other. But in Mulatu’s life, there is no nostalgia.

– Crossing the wilderness –
Mulatu Astatke was born in 1943 in Jimma, about 350 kilometers southwest of the capital Addis Ababa. As a teenager, his parents sent him to study in Britain. “In high school, all I wanted to be was an engineer or a pilot,” he said, smiling. But the drama and music classes he received led him to change his path. In the late 1950s, he enrolled at Trinity College of Music in London to study clarinet and composition. He then headed to New York and Boston, where he became the first African student to attend the Berkeley College of Music. Mulatu, who immediately declared that he did not want to “talk politics” in the interview, returned to Ethiopia to participate in the vibrant Addis Ababa music scene at the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. He would become one of the central figures of “swinging Addis”. But the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie and the rise to power of the military-Marxist Derg regime in 1974 changed the situation. Western music and culture were censored. It was a journey through the wilderness for Mulatu, who claims to have “struggled” during this period as a music teacher. Recognition and success came in 1998 with the release of the “Ethiopiques” collection, which reissued the musical gems of Swinging Addis. Album number four is dedicated to Mulatu. His career then took a spectacular leap in 2005 thanks to the film “Broken Flowers” by American director Jim Jarmusch, which featured four of his compositions on its soundtrack. With this late-arriving international recognition, Mulatu has no plans to “retire,” unlike Mahmoud Ahmed, another Ethio-jazz legend, who gave his final concert in January. Mulatu is returning from a tour of the United States and will perform in September at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. “I have an album which will be released this year. It is called Mulatu plays Mulatu,” he said with a big smile. “But 40, 50 years I’ve been struggling. It took me 40 years to reach world recognition — I am not going to stop now.”"
Stars shine at Met Gala 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/stars-shine-at-met-gala-2025/,2025-05-06T07:43:49+03:00,,"The brightest stars in Hollywood, music, sports and fashion hit the red carpet Monday for the Met Gala, the extravagant Manhattan fundraiser that this year spotlights the subversive style of Black dandyism. The blockbuster night’s theme explores the sharply tailored dandy aesthetic and its rich, complicated history. It also celebrates the opening of a corresponding exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. But for the fashionistas, the Met Gala, always the first Monday in May, is simply one of the world’s top red carpets with blinding star power. Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, two of the co-chairs of fashion’s marquee event, were among the early arrivals alongside gala supremo Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Domingo paid tribute to the late Andre Leon Talley, Vogue’s first Black creative director and one of fashion’s towering figures, in a royal blue Valentino cape with a glittering white collar over a snazzy black and gold jacket and gray tweed trousers. Hamilton meanwhile wowed in a sharp cream suit and matching backwards cap, diamonds glittering in his ears, as well as on his lapel, cuffs and hands. And musician and designer Pharrell Williams, another co-chair, looked snappy in a short, pearl-encrusted white jacket and flared black tuxedo trousers. Tailored suits, bejeweled brooches, canes and jaunty hats were de rigueur for the men. Among the women in attendance, actress Teyana Taylor definitely understood the assignment, arriving in a black suit with red pinstripes and matching huge red coat, the back fully pleated and “Harlem Rose” embossed in the fabric. Rapper Doechii wore a logo-heavy Louis Vuitton cream shorts suit with burgundy accents, a cigar dangling between her lips. And actress Zendaya, always a huge hit at the gala, stunned in a slim white suit and dramatic brimmed hat — perhaps some bridal chic now that she is engaged to Tom Holland? Last to arrive at the party was Rihanna, cradling her new baby bump in an all-black ensemble after revealing she was pregnant as the event began. Her partner A$AP Rocky, a gala co-chair, confirmed the pregnancy on the carpet: “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” ‘New sense of importance’ The gala comes five years after the enormous anti-racist uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement, which pushed a number of cultural institutions in the United States to grapple with their representation of race and diversity. This Met theme is years in the making but now coincides with Donald Trump’s recent efforts to quash institutional initiatives to promote diversity — a push to keep culture and history defined on the Republican president’s terms. The Met Gala and its exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” promises a sharp contrast to that notion, a deep dive into Black dandyism from the 18th century to today. “Obviously, this exhibition was planned many years ago, and we didn’t know what would be happening in the political arena, but it’s taken on a new sense of importance and purpose,” Wintour told AFP. Subversion Guest curator and Barnard professor Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity” was the Met’s inspiration. Her book details how dandyism was a style imposed on Black men in 18th-century Europe, when well-dressed “dandified” servants became a trend. But Black men throughout history subverted the concept as a means of cultivating power, transforming aesthetic and elegance into a means of identity establishment and social mobility. During the vibrant Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, men wore sharp suits and polished shoes as a show of defiance in racially segregated America. “Superfine” is a rare Costume Institute exhibition to spotlight men and male fashion, and the first to focus on Black designers and artists. The Met Gala was first organised in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society, until Wintour transformed the party into a high-profile catwalk for the rich and famous in the 1990s. It remains a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. The famed Manhattan museum said Monday it expected to rake in $31 million this year."
Rihanna reveals third pregnancy at Met Gala,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rihanna-reveals-third-pregnancy-at-met-gala/,2025-05-06T07:28:11+03:00,,"Rihanna loves to make an entrance at the Met Gala, and she certainly did it again Monday — this time, announcing to the world that she is pregnant with her third child with rapper A$AP Rocky. News of the 37-year-old singer and beauty mogul’s new baby bump came before her arrival at the A-list fundraising gala. In a portrait put on Instagram by photographer Miles Diggs, she embraced the Black dandy theme of the gala in a fitted gray Miu Miu blouse and skirt, the baby bump clearly visible, matching knee-high boots, a fur stole and a black cloche hat. Then her long-time partner A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the news to reporters who offered congratulations on the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” the rapper said. “I’m glad everybody’s happy for us because we’re definitely happy.” Finally, after all of the other guests had arrived, Rihanna hit the red carpet in a deconstructed black ensemble with a cropped jacket, polka dot accessories and a wide-brimmed hat. She cradled the baby bump and smiled for the cameras. Rihanna made a similarly high-profile pregnancy reveal in 2023, while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She attended the Met Gala later that year before giving birth. She and A$AP Rocky are parents to sons RZA, born in May 2022, and Riot, born in August 2023. Showing off a baby bump at the Met Gala is a thing: retired tennis superstar Serena Williams did it in 2023, and model Karlie Kloss cradled her bump in both 2023 and again this year."

The song on YouTube currently stands at 4.8M views, and the video directed by Kevin Bosco has seen an uptick in viewership following the Migori debacle.

"“100% tariff on movies produced abroad,” – says President Trump",https://www.kbc.co.ke/100-tariff-on-movies-produced-abroad-says-president-trump/,2025-05-05T13:38:35+03:00,"Creative economy,Film","US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. “I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying, “We’re on it.” No details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented. Trump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 per cent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote Sunday. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,” he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a “National Security threat.” The implications for the movie industry — or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted — were not immediately clear. There was also no mention in Trump’s post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected. US not in top five Hollywood is a major sector of the United States’ economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association. But in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts, which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theatres, the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say. According to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend, though that amount is a 26 per cent drop compared to two years earlier. However, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer. First was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place. Ahead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood. He said they would make the entertainment industry “STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE” in a post on Truth Social. Trump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. How this affects Kenya’s creative economy President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States threatens to derail Kenya’s growing ambitions in the creative economy, particularly its efforts to position itself as a prime filming destination for international studios. In recent years, Kenya has sought to attract U.S. productions through incentives like reduced location fees, support from the Kenya Film Commission, and regional co-production frameworks. In 2024, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and Creative Economy Ababu Namwamba hosted a series of meetings between executives from US-based invention Studios and Kenya film sector stakeholders in Nairobi, where he outlined the measures the Ministry had taken to stimulate partnerships among film creators in the respective countries. “We have developed an incentive framework aimed at mobilising investments in the film sector which is a key component of the Bottom Up Economic Transformation Agenda”, said CS Namwamba at the time. However, with Trump’s policy penalising U.S. filmmakers who shoot abroad, these incentives may now hold less appeal. Instead of encouraging American filmmakers to explore Kenya’s scenic landscapes and rich cultural narratives, the tariffs could push them to remain within U.S. borders to avoid additional distribution costs. This development puts pressure on Kenya’s creative economy blueprint to pivot. Rather than relying on inbound U.S. productions, Kenya may now need to double down on building regional partnerships, supporting local content creation, and tapping into other international markets such as Europe, Asia, and Africa, where trade relations remain more stable and welcoming to co-productions. The long-term vision for Kenya’s film industry may require greater self-reliance and strategic diversification."
Kardashian ready to ‘confront’ her Paris attackers in court,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kardashian-ready-to-confront-her-paris-attackers-in-court/,2025-05-05T12:40:50+03:00,"armed robbery,France","Kim Kardashian is ready to “confront” her Paris attackers as the US celebrity prepares to testify in person next week at a trial over an armed robbery of her jewellery in 2016, her lawyers said Monday. “She is committed to attending in person the trial and to confronting those who attacked her. She will do so with dignity and courage,” her French lawyers Leonor Hennerick and Jonathan Mattout told AFP. In late April, 10 suspects went on trial in Paris over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, Kardashian, then 35, was robbed while staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris. She was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. Kardashian, who has been keeping abreast of developments during the first week of the trial, is due to testify on May 13 in a court appearance certain to attract huge media attention. The lawyers, who are representing Kardashian alongside her American counsel Michael Rhodes, declined to comment on the content of her upcoming testimony. “We want to give everyone the opportunity to hear her testimony in her own words so we won’t be commenting on the substance of what she will say,” they said in a statement. During what the French press has dubbed the “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the Parisian hotel with millions of dollars worth of jewels in 2016, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, her lawyers said, “is genuinely grateful for the way in which the French authorities conducted the investigation that led to the discovery of the persons facing charges in this trial. “Throughout the process, the utmost respect and consideration has been given for Ms. Kardashian,” they said. She “will cooperate with the judicial process and answer all questions,” her lawyers added. The trial is due to last until May 23."

The new episodes are also expected to air in North America on BET. Ahead of the show’s return, the show’s cast, crew, producers, partners and media gathered at The Tamarind Brasserie for an exclusive first look at the series. At the heart of this new chapter is an eclectic and diverse cast of rising and established talent including Serah Wanjiru, Basil Mungai, Matthew Ngugi, Wilson Muchemi, Fatuma Gichuru, Julie Brenda, Fridah Mumbe, Mariam Bishar and Makena Kahuha, each delivering powerful and authentic performances, adding to the emotional depth of the series. Speaking at the premiere event, Wame Jallow, Executive Director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, called coming back to Kenya “special.” “It’s very special for us to be back in Kenya. The very first MTV Shuga made here in 2009 marked the beginning of what would become a global broadcast franchise, spanning across South Africa, Nigeria, India and beyond,” she said. “But MTV Shuga is more than just a series; it’s a movement.  “It has sparked important and often difficult conversations among young people worldwide. The return of Shuga to Kenya affirms the work we’ve been doing at the MTV Staying Alive Foundation for the past 25 years.  “We know this isn’t about quick wins, it’s about creating deep, long-term and meaningful impact. Through the Surround Sound Kenya programme, we aim to drive better health and educational outcomes for young people across the country.” The show’s powerhouse team of Kenyan directors: June Ndinya, Mkaiwawi “Mkay” Mwakaba and Likarion Wainaina,  were in attendance at the premiere. Representing a new era in Kenyan storytelling, the trio has brought their groundbreaking experience in film and television to MTV Shuga Mashariki, elevating the production with rich narratives and a bold cinematic vision. Also present was respected cinematographer and filmmaker Enos Olik, whose signature eye as Director of Photography has been instrumental in shaping the show’s striking visual identity. His work ensures the series is not only emotionally powerful but also visually unforgettable. Reuben Odanga of Multan Production Limited – the powerhouse behind numerous celebrated Kenyan series who was tasked with bringing the series to life, was also in attendance. Mitchelle Kimathi, Country Manager (Kenya) at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, said the story was uniquely Kenyan. “We are incredibly proud to present MTV Shuga Mashariki as a uniquely Kenyan story, created by and for young people across the country. The strength of our cast and creative team reflects our commitment to delivering content that the audience can relate to, owing to our intention to engage in meaningful storytelling that reflects the realities of Kenyan youth.” Developed under the Surround Sound Kenya Programme, this season builds on MTV Shuga’s legacy as Africa’s leading youth drama, a platform for both social impact and creative excellence.  Through compelling characters and bold narratives, the series unpacks issues that affect young people and their outcomes.  Each one of the 8 episodes is designed to spark honest conversations that matter and challenge harmful norms, reinforcing MTV Shuga’s mission to change lives through storytelling. In the first episode, a wild night at Club Baze, the campus hotspot, triggers a chain reaction of betrayal, heartbreak and life-altering choices, forcing the students to confront one question: Who are you, really — when nobody is watching?  At the core of MTV Shuga Mashariki is a daring, unfiltered exploration of what it means to come of age in today’s hyper-connected world.  Set in the vagabond world of campus life, Enkare University, the show follows a group of students as they navigate love, identity, mental health and sexuality, all under the pressures of family expectations, social media validation and economic realities."

Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to Lady Gaga’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters.” It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in an attack “aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.” Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong stage show on Copacabana beach in a year after a huge concert last year by Madonna. Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed."
Egyptian drama shatters silence on child abuse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/egyptian-drama-shatters-silence-on-child-abuse/,2025-05-03T08:41:58+03:00,"EGYPT,Egyptian drama","In living rooms across Egypt, a television drama has shattered the silence around child sexual abuse, forcing a national reckoning with a subject long buried in taboo. The show, “Lam Shamseya”, follows school administrator Nelly, portrayed by leading actor Amina Khalil, as she confronts an unthinkable reality: her stepson has been abused by a trusted family friend. In a country where discussions of sex and sexual violence are often muffled by social norms, the series has ignited rare open dialogue. It has also led to a noticeable uptick in calls to Egypt’s child protection hotline. “We don’t talk about these things in our culture,” said Amira Abu Shady, a 43-year-old mother. “After this show, I sat with my son and told him he can always tell me anything.” For Hend Adel, a 41-year-old mother of three, the show stirred deep unease. “It made me question everything. Who do we trust with our children?” Egyptian dramas, particularly during the peak Ramadan season, have often tackled thorny social issues like drug addiction, custody and women’s struggles in Egypt’s patriarchal society. But sexual abuse, particularly involving children, has largely remained off-limits due to the intense stigma associated with such accusations and the social pressure to protect what is often referred to as family “honour”. “This is the first time viewers have seen these experiences reflected on the screen with such honesty and boldness,” said veteran art critic Magda Khairallah. – 21,000 calls for help –
Last year, Egypt’s National Council for Childhood and Motherhood recorded over 21,000 reports of children at risk, including cases of sexual abuse, physical violence and neglect. “The actual number is far higher,” Sabry Osman, head of the council’s child helpline, told AFP. Many families fear the stigma that comes with speaking out, he said. “So, they stay silent.” That culture of silence is precisely what drew 12-year-old Ali al-Beialy to take on the role of Youssef, the young boy at the heart of the story. “Mr Karim told me I would be a voice for the voiceless,” he said in an interview with Egyptian TV channel On TV last month, referring to series director Karim El-Shenawy. The action in the show, now streaming across the region, unfolds after Nelly catches family friend Wissam, played by Mohamed Shahin, in a troubling embrace with Youssef. As Nelly seeks the truth, she has to push through the denial, fear and resistance even from those closest to her who are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable truth. Youssef, traumatised and confused, slowly begins to understand what has happened to him. “People always deny that it’s most often relatives who commit this abuse, they don’t want to see that it’s actually within the child’s inner circle,” screenwriter Mariam Naoum said on a recent talk show. Naoum insisted the series would air on national television to reach the widest possible audience. “I wanted as many Egyptians and Arabs to see this,” she said in a Facebook livestream. According to UNICEF Egypt child protection specialist Salma ElFawal, most abuse happens “at home, schools and in the cyberspace”, and stigma often prevents families from educating their children or seeking help. – ‘Hesitation and fear’ –
The UN children’s agency reported a direct impact from the series airing, noting a rise in calls to national child protection services during and after the broadcast. Survivors have also increasingly shared their stories online, ElFawal said. This week, a real-life case caught nationwide attention as a 79-year-old school staffer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy — a rare moment of accountability in such cases. Though the show ends with Youssef regaining his voice and his abuser facing justice, the story’s resolution is more hopeful than reality often allows. In “Lam Shamseya”, characters have access to legal and emotional support, a luxury many Egyptians, particularly in marginalised communities, do not share. Though Egyptian law carries severe penalties for child abuse, including life imprisonment for those in positions of authority, legal experts say many cases fail to reach court. Egypt’s many street children, in particular, are among the most vulnerable, often falling through the cracks of the justice system. Even within more privileged households, few cases make it to court. “For a case to hold up, it requires immediate action from parents,” said Hala Abdel Kader, a lawyer and head of the Egyptian Foundation for Family Development. The abuse must be recent and the child sometimes needs to undergo a forensic medical examination, according to Abdel Kader. “Too often, hesitation and fear get in the way,” she told AFP."
UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges/,2025-05-02T19:41:33+03:00,"rape,Russell Brand","British comedian and actor Russell Brand made his first appearance in court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences. Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month. He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. Brand denies the charges. Arriving for the hearing, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside Westminster Magistrates Court in central London. The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear next at London’s Old Bailey criminal court on May 30. In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video. The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023. London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information” to contact officers. – Millions of online fans –
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London. He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster. The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire. Following the short hearing, Brand — who announced that he had become a Christian last year — quoted the Bible in an X post on Thursday, saying, “The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still”. He also reposted American conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who slammed the legal case as “political and absurd”. Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager. He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online. He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8 million on Instagram. He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008, but quit after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter. He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies. Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012. He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children."
Creatives urge stakeholders to begin discussion about film royalties,https://www.kbc.co.ke/creatives-urge-stakeholders-to-begin-discussion-about-film-royalties/,2025-05-02T19:00:45+03:00,"Creative economy,culture","A fireside chat held during MultiChoice Kenya’s 30th anniversary celebrations has sparked fresh debate around the future of the country’s creative economy, with artists calling for recognition, policy support, and discussions about royalties. Gathered at the milestone event in Nairobi were actors, directors and industry stakeholders who took the opportunity to reflect on the past, present and future of Kenyan storytelling. The conversation began as panellists Philip Karanja, Pascal Tokodi, Ainea Ojiambo and Joe Kinyua paid tribute to the shows that paved the way for today’s productions.  Popular programmes from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), including Vioja Mahakamani, Vitimbi, and Tausi,  were recognised as foundational to Kenya’s growth in visual storytelling. “Before Multichoice, we had KBC. Those shows were more than just entertainment,” Ainea Ojiambo said. “They were part of our national identity and have shaped how we tell our stories today.” The discussion further acknowledged other Kenya productions whose success have had an impact in the industry.  The discussion also centred on the runaway success of local productions under MultiChoice’s platforms, including Selina, Zari and Njoro wa Uba.  Njoro wa Uba, which follows the life of a Nairobi taxi driver navigating financial and social challenges, was celebrated as a standout show with many in the audience praising it as the most authentic Kenyan show currently on air. Joe Kinyua, the actor behind the titular Njoro, said he remained surprised by the show’s enduring popularity. “It still amazes me how popular the show has become,” he said during the chat, noting how the story resonated with everyday struggles faced by many Kenyans.  The conversation later shifted to the structural challenges facing creatives, particularly the lack of royalty payments for actors in Kenya’s film industry. Actor and musician Pascal Tokodi raised the issue, calling on MultiChoice to open a discussion about the establishment of a royalties framework that would ensure artists and their families are compensated whenever their work is aired or streamed. “I would love to ask MultiChoice… if we could have a conversation about royalties so that actors can live off their work,” Pascal Tokodi said. “It’s sad when I see an actor who was famous in a big show struggling 3 or 4 years later, and the show is still running.”  His remarks struck a chord with many in the room, as other panellists and attendees nodded in agreement. Some noted that without such structures in place, even the most successful productions fail to secure long-term income for the people who create them. The Principal Secretary for Youth Affairs and the Creative Economy, Fikirini Jacobs, later acknowledged the need to create policy and pledged the government’s willingness to partner with stakeholders in the industry. “As a state department, we assure you that we want to partner with MultiChoice and other stakeholders to create regulations and find incentives which will go a long way in capitalising the creative economy,” he said. The anniversary event brought together stars of Kenya’s small screen, including Selina actress Celestine Gachuhi, Sue and Jonny’s Daddy Marto, Selina director Reuben Odanga, and Mvera director Daudi Anguka, among others."
Daudi Anguka pushes to make Mombasa film production hub,https://www.kbc.co.ke/daudi-anguka-pushes-to-make-mombasa-film-production-hub/,2025-05-02T12:29:42+03:00,"Creative economy,Daudi Anguka","Kenyan filmmaker Daudi Anguka is calling for increased investment in Mombasa’s creative economy, positioning the coastal city as Kenya’s next major centre for film production.  Anguka, who made history with film Mvera, the country’s submission to the 96th Academy Awards and the first ever from Mombasa, believes the region’s storytelling potential remains vastly untapped. “Mombasa has talent. It’s time film distributors and content buyers see this city not just as a location, but as a hub,” Anguka, who grew up in the Bangladesh slums of Mombasa, told CNN. “We have upcoming filmmakers, and we have big producers. There are so many good stories here.” Anguka’s journey into film began with a UNICEF-sponsored scholarship to study at the Kibera Film School through Hot Sun Foundation.  Equipped with a camera, he started writing and filming community-focused stories from his neighbourhood. His earliest works, including short films and stage plays, tackled pressing social issues faced by residents of Mombasa’s informal settlements. Today, Anguka is not only a filmmaker but also a mentor, having trained and guided a new generation of storytellers.  His long-time mentee, Assistant Director Tevan Kinyua, recalls learning the craft through Anguka’s early projects: “After high school, he started coaching me in film. His first project was where I learned to be an assistant director.” Anguka rose to prominence in 2019 with Pete, a Swahili-language television drama that aired on Showmax and was filmed on Funzi Island.  “I intentionally kept the island’s name in the show,” he explained, adding that the visibility helped drive local tourism in the area. “What made Pete unique was the story, the culture, and the environment,” Anguka said. “These are the kinds of narratives that have been missing from our screens, stories rooted in the Swahili coastal identity, stories people can relate to.” His more recent work, Mkasi, currently airing on Maisha Magic Plus, continues that tradition of cultural storytelling, reflecting everyday experiences and historical inspiration.  Anguka has cited Mekatilili wa Menza, Kenya’s iconic coastal resistance heroine, as a key influence for Mvera, describing the film’s protagonist as a modern-day Mekatilili. Now in his early 30s, Anguka’s ambitions go beyond borders. “I just want to make a story that can cross boundaries all over the world,” he said."
Kenya in Top 10 for digital rights as film on internet freedoms premieres at DRIF,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-in-top-10-for-digital-rights-as-film-on-internet-freedoms-premieres-at-drif/,2025-05-02T10:13:06+03:00,"culture,Digital freedoms","Kenya has been ranked among the top 10 African countries in a newly introduced Digital Rights Score Index as part of the 2024 Londa report released by the pan-African digital rights organisation Paradigm Initiative (PIN), assessing their compliance with key human rights elements  The report, unveiled at the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF) in Lusaka, Zambia, evaluates the state of digital rights and freedoms across 27 African nations. South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Namibia, and Rwanda lead the index, with Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Tunisia, and Kenya completing the top 10.  The ranking is based on countries’ compliance with key human rights principles outlined in the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information. However, despite its top 10 placement, the report highlights Kenya’s regression in promoting open internet access.  Kenya was among several countries, alongside Comoros, Mauritius, and Mozambique, cited for implementing government-imposed internet shutdowns in 2024. “The marked increase in internet shutdowns is a reflection of the reluctance of some African countries to comply with international human rights law,” the report states, warning that such actions undermine freedom of expression and access to information. The Londa report also highlights other concerning trends, including high data costs that disproportionately affect women, the criminalisation of false news contrary to global standards, and the lack of legal frameworks addressing online gender-based violence.  It notes that while child protection laws exist, many African nations lack policies specifically safeguarding children online. Short Film: Whispers in the Wires In a creative effort to raise awareness, Paradigm Initiative premiered a short film titled Whispers in the Wires at DRIF.  The film, based on findings from the 2023 Londa report, explores the impact of digital rights violations across the continent. It is the fifth short film released by the organisation as part of its advocacy work. Held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from April 29 to May 1, DRIF 2025 attracted more than 1,300 participants from 65 countries, including policymakers, civil society leaders, tech innovators, and representatives from international organisations. Themed “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” the forum featured 122 sessions and was hosted by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with local and international organisations.  DRIF continues to serve as a platform for critical dialogue on digital inclusion, data protection, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.  The forum also saw the launch of “The PIN Story: A Work in Progress”, a book chronicling the journey of the Lagos-based organisation from a small cybercafé to a continent-wide digital rights movement."

"Rap trio, Kneecap, investigated by UK counter terrorism police",https://www.kbc.co.ke/rap-group-kneecap-investigated-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police/,2025-05-02T09:17:37+03:00,"Entertainment,hip-hop","British counter terrorism police have launched an investigation into online videos of Irish rap group Kneecap after the band denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah or inciting violence against UK politicians. The announcement came as nearly 40 other groups and artists, among them Pulp, Paul Weller and Primal Scream, rallied around the band in an escalating row about political messaging at its concerts. Other artists who have offered their support include The Pogues, Massive Attack, Dexys and Thin Lizzy. “As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” the group said in a joint statement. They added there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” the trio for their criticism of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, as well as of British colonialism in Ireland and beyond. Since the row erupted, Kneecap has had several concerts cancelled, including one in southwest England and three in Germany. According to the PA news agency, festivals in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were also monitoring the situation. London’s Metropolitan Police said two videos had been “referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”. The investigation was “now being carried out by officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,” it added. Kneecap on Monday apologised to the families of murdered British politicians and denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Call for ban The row began after police on Sunday said they were examining video footage. One video appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. Those groups, in Gaza and in Lebanon, are banned as terror organisations in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin had urged the band to clarify whether they supported the groups or not. Video also emerged of the Belfast rap trio at a 2023 gig, appearing to show one member saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” The family of Conservative MP David Amess, who was fatally stabbed by an Islamic State group follower in 2021, called for an apology from Kneecap, while the party leader Kemi Badenoch called for the band to be banned. Other politicians have urged organisers of the Glastonbury festival to drop them from this year’s line-up. In its denial issued late on Monday, Kneecap said video footage had been “deliberately taken out of context. “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” it said, adding the band would never “seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever”. “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” it said, also referring to Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a neo-Nazi sympathiser a week before the divisive Brexit referendum. Amess’s daughter Katie, however, welcomed the investigation by counter terrorism police. “Kneecap’s rhetoric is not only abhorrent but poses a direct threat to the safety and well-being of elected officials,” she said. The war in Gaza was caused by an attack in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s military response in Gaza has caused a humanitarian crisis and killed at least 52,243 people, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory’s health ministry."

Cross-cultural collaboration to elevate Kenyan creatives as British Council Launches 2025 Season,https://www.kbc.co.ke/cross-cultural-collaboration-to-elevate-kenyan-creatives-as-british-council-launches-2025-season/,2025-05-01T05:45:08+03:00,"Arts,Creative economy","Highlights The UK/Kenya Season 2025 has launched with promises to redefine international arts collaboration while unlocking real income opportunities for creatives.  Unveiled at a press briefing at the British Council, the Season is a cultural and educational exchange programme connecting Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts, design, and academia. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is a cultural bilateral programme that will celebrate and strengthen the relationship between Kenya and the United Kingdom through the arts and Education,” Sandra Chege, Head of Arts at the British Council Kenya and Director of the Season, said.  Running from May to November 2025, the Season comes at a time when both countries are looking to strengthen cultural diplomacy while investing in their creative economies. In Kenya, particularly, the creative economy is one of Kenya Kwanza’s initiatives aimed at spurring economic growth and development.  Speaking at the press briefing, British Council Country Director Tom Porter said the time was right for the season. “We’re lucky to have had such a great program that the organisation felt it was the right moment to bring it together. Kenya is an amazing place that the UK is really interested in engaging with and has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, creativity and the dynamic youth population. There’s a real appetite on both sides for deeper partnerships. This is the right moment to build on that energy,” he said. Cross-cultural bridge The programme will showcase a broad range of collaborations across various art forms, including music, literature, visual arts, architecture, design, film, and performance.  “We will work with creatives, thought leaders, and audiences from Kenya, Britain, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland, aiming to spark new conversations and deepen cultural understanding,” Sandra Chege said. “We’ve been very intentional about inclusivity. The Season is not just about exhibitions or performances. It’s about fostering cross-cultural understanding, creating jobs, and supporting young people to step into leadership in the arts sector.” Central to the programme’s design is co-creation. Rather than simply exporting or importing artistic talent, the Season nurtures joint storytelling between Kenyan and British artists, with shared authorship, mutual funding, and co-developed platforms. One example is the British Pavilion at the upcoming Venice Biennale.  For the first time in the Pavilion’s nearly 90-year history, it is being curated collaboratively by a UK-Kenya team — including Nairobi-based architects Kabage Karanja and Stella Mutegi of Cave_bureau, UK writer-curator Owen Hopkins, and academic Professor Kathryn Yusoff.  Their exhibition, Geology of Britannic Repair, interrogates how architecture and colonialism have functioned as parallel systems and explores the earth as a medium for healing and memory. Economic impact Beyond the exhibitions and events, UK/Kenya Season 2025 will make a direct economic impact.  One of the programme’s major tools is the Catalyst Grant, which provides up to £5,000 (approx. KSh. 835,000) to Kenyan-British collaborative projects.  In 2024, 19 projects were selected — many led by young creatives and cultural hubs. Of these, 11 received an additional £10,000 (KSh 1.67 million) in 2025 to scale their ideas and showcase their work during the Season. The projects cover a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines: from digital storytelling and dance to creative technology, heritage archives, and socially engaged theatre. “Our hope is to support the ambition of young people as they develop their artistic practice and find their way in the world,” noted Chege.  An example of this ripple effect is Making Space: Inside, Outside, a cross-country collaboration between Nairobi’s GoDown Arts Centre and the UK’s Transform Festival.  The project brings together young curators to co-create public art in Nairobi and a youth-focused festival in Leeds. In Nairobi, the installations will be part of the GoDown’s tactical urbanism efforts, an initiative transforming neglected urban spaces into vibrant community hubs through art. Focus on Kenyan fashion Thanks to a new partnership between the British Council’s Creative DNA programme and the Mastercard Foundation, over KSh. 142 million (USD 1.1 million) has been committed to Kenya’s fashion sector. The funding supports a fashion incubator offering mentorship, market access, business training, and creative development for emerging designers. It’s a deliberate move to professionalise fashion as a viable career path and not just a passion. Speaking to KBC Digital, the British Council Arts Project Manager, Joyce Kanze said that funding towards the fashion sector was based on research. “Fashion continues to attract significant funding in Kenya because it sits at the intersection of culture, entrepreneurship, and youth employment. It’s a highly visible sector with export potential, and it can generate jobs, especially for young people and women,” she said. Nairobi Literature Festival In June, the Season will also spotlight literature through the Nairobi Literature Festival (NBO Litfest) in partnership with the world-renowned Hay Festival in Wales.  Taking place from 26–29 June at the iconic McMillan Memorial Library and its satellite branches in Eastlands and Kaloleni, the festival will explore Alternative Knowledge Systems, placing African narratives, oral histories, and indigenous knowledge at the centre of contemporary dialogue. The Hay Festival in Wales will run from May 22 to June 1, offering reciprocal exposure to British audiences. Writers from both countries will appear at both editions, exchanging ideas and building lasting literary networks. The official launch ceremony for the season will take place on May 2. “The UK/Kenya Season 2025 is not just about celebrating art and culture—it’s about building lasting relationships, both artistic and diplomatic, between our nations, said Ms Chege. “This Season is about strengthening creative economies and using the arts as a vehicle for social change, empowerment, and sustainable growth.”"

To mark this journey, the company has unveiled Your World of More, a special anniversary campaign dedicated to appreciating its loyal customers. Running till September 30, 2025, the Your World of More campaign is a tribute to the millions of viewers who have been part of MultiChoice’s story over the years. As part of the celebrations, MultiChoice is reaffirming its commitment to delivering diverse and premium content across DStv, Showmax, and GOtv—continuing to showcase authentic African stories that resonate with audiences. This milestone underscores the company’s dedication to shaping Kenya’s creative economy and delivering world-class entertainment to audiences. Speaking during the anniversary event at MultiChoice offices, Nzola Miranda, Managing Director of MultiChoice Kenya, said, “For three decades, we have been at the heart of entertainment in this country, shaping the industry and providing a platform for African stories to thrive. This legacy belongs to every Kenyan who has tuned in, shared in the laughter, and celebrated with us,” he said. He added: “Through DStv, GOtv, and Showmax, we continue to expand the boundaries of entertainment, bringing together local narratives that reflect our realities and global spectacles that captivate our imaginations.” He added: “Since 2016, we have invested over $50m in the local film industry and worked with over 30 local production houses who in turn employ hundreds of cast members and small-to-medium-sized businesses contributing to job creation and industry growth. The collaborations have seen us produce over 100 original and exclusive local titles across DStv, GOtv & Showmax, bringing authentic Kenyan stories to life.” Speaking during the same event, Principal Secretary for the State Department for Youth Affairs, the Creative Economy and Sports, Fikirini Jacobs, said, For over 30 years, Multichoice has played a pivotal role in empowering our creative sector, offering skills, mentorship, and real investment in talent.” He added: “As we chart the future, we are proud to deepen this partnership by bringing on board Kenya’s film legends to co-create a hands-on curriculum that will shape the storytellers of tomorrow.” The anniversary celebrations, held with great fanfare, also honoured the legends—actors, producers, and storytellers whose dedication and talent have made MultiChoice a cornerstone of Kenya’s creative economy. Kenya Film Commission CEO Timothy Owase congratulated MultiChoice on this landmark occasion, highlighting its role in advancing Kenya’s creative industry, saying, “MultiChoice has been an instrumental partner in the evolution of Kenya’s film and television sector. Through unwavering support for local talent and a strong commitment to telling authentically African stories, they have elevated our narratives to international audiences.” He also added: “As KFC, we recognise the vital role that MultiChoice continues to play in promoting responsible content and nurturing local talent.

Husband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to death,https://www.kbc.co.ke/husband-of-late-nigerian-gospel-singer-sentenced-to-death/,2025-04-30T07:59:24+03:00,"culture,music","The widower of popular Nigerian gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has been sentenced to death by hanging in connection with her death three years ago. The 42-year-old singer was initially said to have died of throat cancer, before her family went public with allegations of domestic violence. They accused her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, of abusing the music artist, which ultimately led to her death. A judge convicted him of 23 charges, including culpable homicide, and gave him the maximum sentence for the crime. It is unclear if Peter Nwachukwu, who denied the charges, will be executed, as the authorities rarely implement the death sentence. He has the right to appeal. The case, held in the High Court in the capital, Abuja, has drawn much attention in Nigeria because of the musician’s prominence and widespread concern about domestic violence. The late singer, who is survived by four children, was featured on the 2017 hit gospel song Ekwueme, which has more than 136 million YouTube views. Peter Nwachukwu, who was arrested in 2022, was also charged with emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, cruelty to children and criminal intimidation of them. Seventeen people, including two of the couple’s children, were called by the prosecution as witnesses during the trial. Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme found the widower guilty of all the charges, saying the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt."
Groovy Jo: New single ‘Stay Here’ inspired by heartbreak,https://www.kbc.co.ke/groovy-jo-new-single-stay-here-inspired-by-heartbreak/,2025-04-30T08:43:06+03:00,"Entertainment,Groovy Jo","After navigating the storm of a real-life heartbreak, Kenyan rapper and singer Groovy Jo is channeling raw emotion into her latest single, Stay Here. The track that dropped early April promises to bare her soul. In an exclusive conversation, the artist revealed how the song channels the complex emotions of heartbreak while embracing the freedom and release that music offers. “Sometimes the most unexpected encounters ignite the prettiest love stories,” she said. “I met someone who sparked something in me. It scared me a little, but I chose to immerse myself fully in it. And like many things, it eventually rotted and left a distaste,” said Groovy Jo. Known for her expressive and raw storytelling, Groovy Jo says Stay Here is more than just a breakup song. It’s a sonic and emotional release designed to help listeners process heartache without letting it weigh them down. “Heartbreak is heavy, but it doesn’t have to be permanent,” she explained. “I want my listeners to feel everything, but also to find joy, to dance through the pain.” Marking a shift in her artistic direction, Groovy Jo blends her signature lyricism with a sound she describes as “Oontz”, a vibrant take on house music infused with hip-hop influences. “I’ve always loved house, but recently it hit me differently,” she said. “The rhythm grounds me but also lets me feel free. I wanted to merge that with my emotions and make something that felt effortless.”  Produced by Lemario, Stay Here balances vulnerability and groove, delivering a soundscape that mirrors the duality of heartbreak, sadness and release, pain and movement. “The beat keeps you moving, but the lyrics hit deep,” she noted. “It’s the push and pull of emotions that keep you dancing even when your heart is heavy.” As for how this experience has changed her outlook on love, Groovy Jo admits the breakup shifted her perspective. Stay Here may be the start of a new era for Groovy Jo, who hinted that this won’t be a one-off experiment. “It’s definitely the beginning of something new,” she affirmed. “Not a complete shift, but an expansion of my sound and I’m excited to explore it more.” Fans can expect the same heartfelt storytelling, but now with an infectious beat that invites them to feel, heal, and, most importantly, dance."

New platform to help content creators,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-platform-to-help-content-creators/,2025-04-29T06:55:33+03:00,"creator economy,culture","Local content creators are set to benefit from the launch of an innovative digital marketplace dubbed Zaumu. The marketplace, which is an end-to-end influencer campaign management solution digital platform, will enable creators and influencers to access jobs and source projects directly from brands listed on the marketplace. The platform aims to bridge the gap between creators and brands by enabling them to collaborate directly and measure the impacts of campaigns and projects. According to Zaumu co-founder Cedric Nzomo, 90% of digital projects earmarked for content creators and influencers never see the light of day, despite increasing budget allocations for digital marketing by brands. “Brands subject projects and campaigns to a long process before they can go live. While they see the importance of digital marketing, there is a trust deficit due to improper measurement tools and the lack of transparency between brands and creators during content creation. As a result, it is easier for them to spend on traditional marketing. “Statistically speaking, the 200 billboards between Waiyaki Way and the Nairobi CBD made more money in 2024 than all the content creators across different platforms in Kenya,” Cedric said. According to Statista, Kenya’s estimated influencer marketing spend stood at $2.5 Million (over Ksh. 320 M) in 20243 against a potential spend of $25 Million (Over 3.2 B). The mismatch in spending is due to several factors and gaps. First is the mismatch between brand needs and creator briefs. Under the current system, brands rely on third-party recommendations and public trends to identify suitable creators. As a result, brands are often connected to creators who do not meet their needs, while creators are subject to payment delays, low pay, and exploitation. “Brands are often not able to vet creators who suit or align with their values, while creators are forced to take on any job to ensure they survive. We are looking to bridge the gap between creators and brands. Zaumu is a creator-focused, AI-driven digital marketplace tailored to meet the needs of Africa’s digital economy.” Cedric said. The marketplace will offer: 1. Transparent Job Listing enabling brands to list jobs with budgets accessible to all creators accredited on the platform. Payments will be deposited on the platform before work begins and released based on project milestones 2. Streamlined contracting through the platform that will enable prompt payment based on milestones. It will also enable creators to have more visibility and control of their intellectual property rights, sign off on the use of their image and likeness, and proprietary content for the duration of the campaign 3. Direct and secure communication between brands and creators, enabling them to co-create, with speed and ease of access, while guaranteeing privacy and protection of the creative process and intellectual property 4. Automated reporting enabling brands to directly track projects and creators to adjust projects to meet milestones and secure timely payment 5. Feedback and review features to enable both creators and brands to review and rate each other, building a transparent reputation system that fosters accountability. 6. AI-Powered Tools with built-in integrated AI assistance to help in brainstorming, moderation, and support services. “The digital economy holds diverse opportunities for wealth and job creation. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, content creation is an easy stepping stone to tap into this opportunity. According to Odipodev, 76% of Gen Zs aspire to become professional content creators. The beauty of content creation is that you can monetize what you’re already doing. The challenge has been access, transparency & and efficiency, finding a connection to brands and projects. Zaumu has been created to help you overcome these challenges,”  Cedric said."

Gungnir and Storyteller Media have announced a new partnership to publish and develop a powerful slate of original works designed for both page and screen. The other work set for the film pipeline is Darian Sanders’ debut memoir, Don’t Fear Your Roar, published by Storyteller in late 2024. “At Storyteller, we start every publishing conversation by asking, ‘What impact can this story make?’” said Charles Allen, Publisher of Storyteller Media. “We believe Daughter of Africa and Don’t Fear Your Roar are perfect examples of stories making a meaningful impact, and we are thrilled to amplify their voices with readers and viewers around the world.” With a built-in book-to-film pipeline, powered by Curiosity Entertainment’s critically acclaimed team, this alliance represents a bold new model for publishing, where stories are developed with multi-platform potential from the outset. Whether memoir, fiction, or graphic novel, each release is backed by the resources and industry reach of a proven entertainment powerhouse. Curiosity Entertainment is currently in preproduction, working on a slate of projects including the next show by co-creator of Ozark, Mark Williams, a feature film co-production with Panay Films, and a television show by The Umbrella Academy writers, the Neese Brothers. “At Curiosity, we believe in supporting stories from their very first spark to their final frame. Through Storyteller Media and our partnership with Gungnir, we’re able to go upstream, discovering bold and visionary IP early and cultivating it for the screen. This is how we build legacy stories that last,” Adhrucia Apana, Founder, Curiosity Entertainment said. Ahead of the film, the autobiography, Daughter of the Soil,  will be re-released for North American audiences in 2025 with an entirely new work by Din – A companion workbook on leadership and legacy, designed to offer practical guidance for entrepreneurs rooted in the author’s vast business experience as founder of Africa’s most awarded PR firm, The Gina Din Group. The Gungnir-Storyteller alliance represents a new model in publishing: one where creators retain ownership, secure mainstream traditional distribution, receive tailored publicity support, and see their work considered for high-quality screen adaptation from day one. The full 2025–2026 publishing slate will be announced in the coming months and includes titles spanning memoir, genre fiction, graphic novels, and social impact storytelling, all designed for potential adaptation into film and television. “Our goal at Gungnir has always been to create narratives that go beyond the expected,” said Matt Medney, CEO of Gungnir Publishing. “Storyteller’s approach to turning books into cross-media experiences aligns perfectly with our mission.

Trial begins in Paris over 2016 gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian,https://www.kbc.co.ke/trial-begins-in-paris-over-2016-gunpoint-robbery-of-kim-kardashian/,2025-04-28T08:23:13+03:00,"$10 million worth of jewellery,Aomar Ait Khedache","Ten suspects go on trial in Paris on Monday over the 2016 robbery of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian, which saw some $10 million worth of jewellery stolen from the reality TV star and influencer. Kardashian, now 44 — who left Paris traumatised hours after the robbery on the night of October 2-3, 2016 — is due to testify at the trial on May 13 in a court appearance that will be a major event in itself. Those on trial are mainly men in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames like “Old Omar” and “Blue Eyes” that recall the old-school French bandits of 1960s and 1970s film noirs. Kardashian, then 35, was threatened with a gun to the head and tied up with her mouth taped up. The theft was the biggest against a private individual in France in the past 20 years. The trial will also go into how the perpetrators received the information as to where Kardashian was staying during Paris Fashion Week, and picked the very moment when her bodyguard was absent, accompanying her sister Kourtney to a night club. It is thought Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. The trial gets under way from 1230 GMT. – Haul never recovered –
The star was staying at an exclusive hotel in central Paris favoured by celebrities when two armed and masked men stormed into her room at around 3:00 am after arriving at the establishment by bicycle. They shouted that they wanted the diamond engagement ring from her now ex-husband, the US rapper Kayne West. Kardashian had been showing it off on her social media channels — it alone was valued at $4 million (3.5 million euros). They made off with the ring among $10 million worth of jewels. The only item recovered was a diamond necklace dropped in the street while the thieves escaped. It all lasted just 10 minutes, with Kardashian’s bodyguard arriving to rescue his client after he was alerted. The suspects were arrested three months after the robbery, through DNA evidence. But the gold seized was apparently melted down and investigators, who took hundreds of thousands of euros from the suspects when they were arrested, believe that much of the stolen haul was sold in Belgium. – ‘Easy’ heist –
Twelve suspects were charged, with 10 going on trial from Monday. One died in March this year and another is to be tried separately for health reasons. “It wasn’t a major armed robbery” but an “easy” heist, said the main suspect, Aomar Ait Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”. His DNA from the scene helped investigators find him and the co-defendants. He admitted tying up Kardashian, but disputes investigators’ claims that he was the mastermind behind the robbery. He says he was approached by an unnamed “sponsor” who suggested the scheme on behalf of an “informant” very close to the star, who then gave them the green light. According to his lawyer, Khedache now has severe hearing and speaking problems and can only express himself in writing. Another key suspect is Didier Dubreucq, 69, known as “Blue Eyes”, accused of being the second person who stormed into Kardashian’s room. He denies the charges. Yunice Abbas, 71, meanwhile stayed in the lobby while the two other men went up to her room, it is alleged. He controversially sought to capitalise on the crime by writing a book titled: “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian”. Others on trial are accused of being facilitators and informants, including Gary Madar, the brother of Kardashian’s long-serving Paris driver. He is accused of supplying information about her movements, which he denies. Despite the “media hype”, the trial “must allow for calm debates”, warned one of the defence lawyers, Margot Pugliese. The trial is due to last until May 23."
‘Godfather’ director honoured with Lifetime Achievement award,https://www.kbc.co.ke/godfatherdirector-honoured-with-lifetime-achievement-award/,2025-04-28T08:50:05+03:00,"Entertainment,Film","The 86-year-old director of classics including “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” received a trophy from fellow filmmaking legends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who lauded him for fighting the system and redefining American cinema.   “Star Wars” creator Lucas recalled Coppola telling him “don’t be afraid of jumping off cliffs,” while Spielberg hailed the “fearless” director and said that “The Godfather” was “the greatest American film ever made.”   “You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film, and in so doing, you’ve inspired a generation of storytellers,” Spielberg said.   The award was given by the prestigious American Film Institute, which produces annual lists of the best films ever made and is seen as one of the industry’s most respected bodies.   Taking the podium at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in front of film veterans including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, Coppola said that winning the award felt like coming home.   “Now I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn’t really a place at all, but you, friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,” Coppola said.   The six-time Academy Award winner was praised by the AFI as a “dreamer”, a “pioneer” and also a “maverick.”   Coppola, who famously threw five of his Oscars out a window in an outburst while making “Apocalypse Now,” heard emotional tributes from peers including De Niro, Al Pacino, Diane Lane, Harrison Ford and Ralph Macchio, who thanked the filmmaker for taking a chance on them.   “When the studio wanted stars, you fought for actors,” said “Rain Man” star Hoffman.   He joked that Coppola launched so many young actors’ careers, but only cast him in last year’s sci-fi drama “Megalopolis” when Hoffman was 86.   The independent AFI has honoured the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino in previous years.   Pacino joined De Niro to pay tribute to Coppola, who directed them in the second installment of “The Godfather” trilogy.   Coppola, who battled studio executives to make the film according to his own vision, told AFP that there is no art without adventure.   “I think making art without risk is like making babies without sex. It’s possible, but it’s not the best way to do it,” he said."
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville.

Youssef El Gatou brought together 20 chefs to make the 1.2 tonne masterpiece that took a week to complete and was set out on tables in an ice rink in the Paris suburb town of Argenteuil for residents to inspect. The effort overtook a 100.48m (329 ft 7 in) long strawberry cake made in the Italian town of San Mauro Torinese in 2019. El Gatou’s cake also used 350 kilogrammes of strawberries, 150kg of sugar and 415kg of cream. To claim the record in the Guiness book, the cake had to be at least eight centimetres wide and eight centimetres tall. The logistics were so difficult that the team “used blowtorches to heat the bowl” for the cream mix, said the chef’s wife Nadia El Gatou. El Gatou said that since a child he had wanted to set a record. “I was looking for a product, or a French pastry, and I also wanted to highlight farm produce, so French strawberries and products like milk, cream and butter,” he told AFP.

Dr. Billy Kahora, Project Partner and Editorial Consultant, shares that he felt energised by the submissions. “African creative non-fiction is in rude health and I just can’t wait to collaborate with these amazing writers – what was so pleasing was the variety of style and theme as warrants the idea of Citizenship on the continent.” Over the course of a 10-day intensive, fully-funded residential workshop in Accra, Ghana, the selected cohort of writers will benefit from the expertise of tutors and mentors who will support each writer in developing their proposal into full-length non-fiction pieces to be published in the Citizen anthology.

In addition to being an all-round creative, Mr Elba is the founder of the Akuna Group, which seeks to empower young people through the creative industry, agriculture and infrastructure, which he alluded to in his question to Charlene. “I think being conscious while creating, knowing we’ll influence the next generation, is really very important. And when we think about how that connects to the climate crisis, the food crisis, we are creative human beings,” he said during his presentation.

Charlene was attending the summit as a representative of the Kenyan youth. The theme for the second edition of the summit is “Building our Legacy: Sustainability, Innovation and Traditional Knowledge” which highlights Qatar’s commitment to advancing sustainability in hot and arid environments by drawing on its rich cultural heritage and unique ecosystems.

Written by Erik Satie in 1893, “Vexations” is described as “one of classical music’s most simple, yet arduous and demanding works”. Satie’s manuscript included a composer’s note instructing that it should be repeated 840 times, a feat which generally takes between 16-20 hours of continuous playing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Levit livestreamed a “Vexations” performance from a Berlin studio. He also streamed dozens of “concerts” from his flat in the German city to highlight the challenges faced by artists during lockdown. Although numerous pianists playing in succession have succeeded in performing “Vexations” over the years, it has rarely been completed in its entirety by a single musician. Tickets have been priced from £32 for a one hour slot with others available for the full-length performance. Levit, who is a professor at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, has released a dozen albums of classical works including Beethoven’s complete piano sonatas and concertos by Brahms. Levit told The Guardian daily he’d “never tell an audience” what they should hope to experience. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it,” he said. “It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream,” he added. Abramovic, 78, an art world icon, has earned worldwide acclaim for her work that has frequently tested her own physical and mental endurance. In one of her best known early works Rhythm O, Abramovic invited audiences to interact with her in any way they chose which resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. The “Vexations” performance will begin at 10:00am (0900GMT) on Thursday."
Gloria Kimani to shine at Little Miss Universe,https://www.kbc.co.ke/gloria-kimani-to-shine-at-little-miss-universe/,2025-04-22T11:09:34+03:00,"Beauty,culture","Ten-year-old Gloria Karen Wairimu Kimani is not your average pre-teen. With a vibrant spirit and a heart full of dreams, she’s carving a remarkable path in the worlds of modelling, singing, and acting. This young talent has already amassed an impressive list of achievements, proving that age is no barrier to pursuing your passions. Her journey into the spotlight has seen her crowned 2nd Princess Miss Kenya, Preteen Miss Fashionista, and Pre-teen Miss Kenya Muranga County. She also walked away with the title of Best Casual Wear Little Miss Kenya and secured an impressive 1st runner-up position at Miss Africa. In 2024, adding to her accolades, Gloria Karen was recognised as the Kids Influencer of the Year at the 2024 Miss Independent Kenya Awards. Now, this bright star is set to shine even brighter. Due to her consistent achievements, Gloria Karen has been selected to represent Kenya as a finalist in the prestigious Little Miss Universe competition set to take place in May in India.  It’s a testament to her unwavering belief in turning dreams into tangible goals. “It has been a long journey with ups and downs,” Gloria Karen shares, her youthful voice filled with a wisdom beyond her years, “but the focus is always on positive things.” This journey has brought incredible advantages to Gloria Karen’s life. It’s opening doors to the international modelling scene and providing platforms to connect with influential figures in Kenya, from beloved celebrities to respected politicians. More importantly, her platform has allowed her to give back in a meaningful way. “Through this journey, I was able to open my foundation,” she explains with pride. This foundation is dedicated to a range of compassionate initiatives, including feeding street children, supporting needy families, visiting the elderly, and bringing cheer to sick children in hospitals, especially those with cleft lip and palate. The exposure has also fostered a strong sense of community around her. “Through this platform, people get to know me, and I get a lot of support when I have an event and help in terms of money and physical items like clothing and foodstuffs,” she says. Beyond the tangible benefits, Gloria Karen emphasises the personal growth she’s experienced. “This journey has helped me gain courage and confidence,” she says despite all the ups and downs. Like any journey, there have been challenges; Gloria Karen acknowledges the occasional negative comments and the frequent question of balancing her passions with her studies; late-night events and the financial demands of competitions also present challenges.  Despite this, she remains optimistic and grateful and offers a heartfelt recommendation to parents. “I would encourage other parents to support their kids who have talents,” expressing her gratitude. “Thanks to my parents, my dad for his monetary, psychological, and mental support all the time I have events, and my mum for always sacrificing her time to make sure I am in the event and also making sure all the attires are ready in time and also being my good manager.” She also sends a message of appreciation to her broader network of supporters. “To all those people who have tirelessly prayed and supported me, don’t get tired, and may God Almighty bless you.” Looking towards the future, Gloria Karen has a special message for the leader of her nation. “To the President of Kenya, thank you so much for recognising and appreciating talents. Supporting us young kids who have talents.” Finally, her heartfelt prayers are with her biggest champion, her father. “Finally, my prayers are to my dad, who is a PhD holder, to get a better job to always be in a position to support me fully, because some of the opportunities I miss are due to a lack of finances.” Gloria Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that passion, dedication, and a supportive community can propel even the youngest among us to achieve extraordinary things."

‘Sinners’ surpasses ‘Minecraft’ at Box Office in first outing,https://www.kbc.co.ke/sinners-surpasses-minecraft-at-box-office-in-first-outing/,2025-04-22T09:41:59+03:00,"Entertainment,International","Sinners, an original, blood-soaked vampire tale, has defied expectations and risen to the top of the box office, overtaking A Minecraft Movie with a $45.6 million (KSh. 5.9B) debut. Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan in dual roles, Sinners marks a rare victory for originality in a marketplace ruled by intellectual property. The Warner Bros. film, set in 1932 Mississippi and revolving around bootlegging brothers turned nightclub owners, edged out A Minecraft Movie, which brought in $41.3 million (KSh. 5.3B) in its third weekend. Despite Minecraft’s $720.8 million global haul to date, the fresh energy and star power of Sinners proved irresistible to U.S. and Canadian audiences over the Easter weekend. Warner Bros., which distributed both films, delivered a box office victory, though it was Sinners that stole the spotlight. The studio backed Coogler with unprecedented terms, including a share of gross profits and eventual ownership of the film after 25 years, showing deep confidence in his vision. Critics and audiences responded in kind: Sinners earned a 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an “A” CinemaScore, signalling strong word-of-mouth that could sustain its momentum. While Sinners had a softer launch internationally, $15.4 million (KSh. 1.9B)  across 71 markets, its stateside triumph stands out, especially considering Warner Bros.’ previous struggles with dual-role projects like The Alto Knights and Mickey 17."
Conclave: How a new pope is chosen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/conclave-how-a-new-pope-is-chosen/,2025-04-22T09:08:12+03:00,"Catholic Church,Conclave","Following Pope Francis’s death on Monday, cardinals will travel to the Vatican to elect his successor in a process called the conclave, which was made popular over the past year in an Oscar-winning film. Conclave, a film by Edward Berger, has earned over 100 million at the global Box Office since its release and won several awards, including a BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, A Critics’ Choice Award for Best Acting Ensemble and an Academy Award for Best Writing, to name a few. According to the film’s synopsis, Conclave follows one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events of selecting the new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence, played by Ralph Fiennes is tasked with running this covert process after the unexpected death of the beloved Pope as the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Once the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence uncovers a trail of deep secrets leading him to question the circumstances around the Pope’s death.  However, in real life, the process is slightly different. The Catholic Church enters a period known as “Sede Vacante” (Vacant See) during which a senior cardinal takes over day-to-day affairs until a new pope is elected. The cardinal, referred to as the “camerlengo” (“chamberlain”), in this case will be Irish-American Kevin Farrell, appointed to the role by Francis in February 2019. He is the only top official in the Church hierarchy to remain in post, with all others required to resign following the death of the pope. Traditionally, his main role has been to certify the death, once done by tapping the pontiff’s forehead three times with a special silver hammer and calling out his birth name. The camerlengo is also charged with destroying the “Fisherman’s Ring”, a gold signet ring specially cast for each new pope which was once used to seal documents. Originally, its destruction was to prevent forgery, but today the act, in the presence of the cardinals at their first gathering of the Sede Vacante, simply symbolises the end of a papacy. Cardinals from around the world will hold a series of meetings known as “general congregations”. They will decide on a date for the burial, which must take place between the fourth and sixth days after death, and on the organisation of the “novemdiales”, the nine days of mourning. Francis’s immediate predecessors were buried in St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, but he asked to be buried in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. His body will be placed inside a single coffin of wood and zinc, again breaking with tradition, with previous popes interred in three coffins in cypress, lead and elm, placed one inside the other. The change in funeral rituals better reflect what Francis sees as the role of the pope as “a pastor and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world”, a top official said. Francis’s open coffin will be laid out for veneration by the faithful in St Peter’s Basilica, putting an end to the display of papal bodies on a raised platform, propped up by cushions as per tradition. The general congregations are also a good way of vetting “papabili”, potential successors to Francis. The congregations will set the date for a conclave to begin no less than 15 and no more than 20 days after the death of the pope. Under a system originating in the 13th century, the conclave sees cardinals aged under 80 meet in private to choose the next pope from among their peers. Currently, there are 135 so-called “cardinal electors”, 108 of whom were appointed by Francis. Of these 53 are from Europe, 20 are from North America, 18 are from Africa, 23 from Asia, four from Oceania and 17 from South America. Conclave literally means “with a key”, reflecting the fact that the cardinals must stay until a new pope is found. Since the late 19th century, all conclaves have been held in the Sistine Chapel, a Renaissance jewel adorned with Michelangelo’s celebrated frescoes. The cardinals are sworn to absolute secrecy, under pain of excommunication during the voting.
Two ballots are held in the morning and two in the afternoon each day, until one candidate wins two-thirds of the votes.
At the end of each session, the ballots are burned in a stove by the chapel, releasing smoke above the Apostolic Palace. The smoke is black after each unsuccessful ballot, and white once the vote succeeds. The bells of St Peter’s will peal to accompany the white smoke. Once elected, the new pope will be led into a tiny sacristy by the Sistine Chapel known as the “sala delle lacrime”, or Room of Tears, where he can ponder his future. The dean of the College of Cardinals, currently Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, will ask the newly chosen pontiff if he accepts his election and what name he would like to use, and he immediately becomes the bishop of Rome and pope. The new pope is helped into his vestments (three sets are prepared, of different sizes), and one by one the cardinals pay homage to him. Shortly afterwards, he appears on the loggia of St Peter’s Basilica. The senior cardinal deacon, currently Renato Raffaele Martino, will then pronounce the famous phrase in Latin: “Habemus Papam!” (We have a pope!)."
Nigerian Afrobeat legend Femi Kuti takes a look inward,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nigerian-afrobeat-legend-femi-kuti-takes-a-look-inward/,2025-04-21T09:03:13+03:00,"Afrobeat,Eedris Abdulkareem","Sat comfortably in a large chair at the New Afrika Shrine, his family’s legendary Nigerian music venue, Femi Kuti was surrounded by history. The concert hall is an homage to his father Fela Kuti’s original Shrine, which had also been located in the northern outskirts of Lagos before its demise. Femi’s own music awards are scattered around, recognition for his determination to keep fighting the good fight his Afrobeat legend father was known for — calling out corruption and injustice in Africa’s most populous nation. Part of a family defined by its determination to speak defiantly about what was going on around them — whether through lyrics or protest or both — Femi Kuti, however, is ready to turn inward, and focus on the “virtues that have guided me in my life”, he told AFP in a recent interview. Those reflections will be apparent in the 62-year-old’s upcoming album, “Journey Through Life,” his 13th record, set to release on April 25. In the upcoming record, he sings about “the kind of advice I give myself to where I am today,” he said. The title track, for example, is “not political”. But listeners should not expect a member of the Kuti clan to give up politics completely. – From Afrobeat to Afrobeats –
The elder Kuti came to define Afrobeat, the 70s-era jazz- and funk-inspired genre that would later give birth to the modern, R&B-inspired Afrobeats — plural — style shaking up the global music industry today. He was also a poster child of protest — using his lyrics to call out government abuses, even under brutal military juntas that ran Nigeria off and on before its latest transition to democracy in 1999, two years after his death from AIDS. Femi Kuti’s grandmother, meanwhile, was a women’s rights and independence activist. It might be a given, then, that the virtues that guided Femi Kuti would be political in nature — though he has tempered his expectations of what exactly music can do. “My father used to say music is the weapon. I think music is a weapon for change, but it can’t be the soul,” he said. “We still need organisations.” After all, the elder Kuti was repeatedly beaten and jailed by authorities — and with an incomplete record to show for it. Democracy might have eventually taken hold, but the corruption he railed against has been trickier to uproot. “Self-reflection makes me think maybe it’s not possible to change the world. But one thing I’m sure of is that I can change myself, I can make myself a better person,” Kuti told AFP. – New songs, same struggles –
Femi Kuti has spent the last four decades as the heir to his father’s activism and musical style. Together with his son Made and brother Seun, he keeps the New Afrika Shrine a sweaty, bumping place to be each Sunday night, and continues to tour internationally. The album, Kuti promised, is “still very political” — and Kuti has some of his own thoughts to share as well. “I’ve been singing political songs for 38 years,” yet not much has changed. In “Nigeria, it’s gotten worse”. “Corruption must stop in the political class,” he said. “Everybody thinks the only way to be successful is through corruption.” “The health care — there’s nothing that works,” he said. “We can’t afford a good education (for children).” These days he is unlikely to be beaten or jailed like his father — which traumatised his family growing up, he said. Though things are not always rosy for musicians in the modern political climate either. Broadcasting authorities earlier this month banned “Tell Your Papa”, by Eedris Abdulkareem, for its lyrics blasting President Bola Tinubu’s handling of the economic and security situation in the country. The government is pursuing painful — though necessary, it argues — economic reforms, while insecurity from jihadist groups continues to menace the country’s north. “It will probably be very hard for me to not talk on political subjects,” Kuti admitted, before an electrifying live performance at an all-night show. “I’ve lived it all my life with my father”"
‘Grandpa robbers’ go on trial for Kim Kardashian heist in Paris,https://www.kbc.co.ke/grandpa-robbers-go-on-trial-for-kardashian-heist-in-paris/,2025-04-21T07:48:19+03:00,"Aomar Ait Khedache,France","A group of suspects nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” goes on trial at the end of April, charged with stealing jewellery worth millions from US reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. In what the French press has called “the heist of the century”, masked men walked away from the luxury Parisian hotel where Kardashian was staying in October 2016 with millions of dollars worth of jewels, including a diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, rapper Kanye West. Kardashian will testify in person at the trial, which opens on April 28, her US lawyer Michael Rhodes said last week. Ten people will be in the dock and the verdict is expected on May 23, with Kardashian set to appear on May 13, according to a provisional schedule. In what has been called the biggest French hold-up targeting an individual in 20 years, Kardashian was robbed of jewellery estimated at 10 million euros ($11.4 million at current rates) while she was staying at a luxury residence during Paris fashion week. Among the suspects arrested four months later in Paris and in the south of France is Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68, who has admitted to his participation in the heist, but denies the prosecution’s accusation that he was also the ringleader. Two investigating magistrates ordered the suspects to stand trial by jury — which in France is reserved for the most serious crimes — on charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and membership of a criminal gang. On the night of October 2-3, 2016, several men, some impersonating police officers, entered the hotel where Kardashian, who was then 35, was staying during Fashion Week. The star had attended a Givenchy show before returning to the hotel around midnight without her bodyguard who was with her sister Kourtney, also a media personality and socialite, who had gone clubbing. – An ‘easy’ heist –
Two of the intruders put guns to her head and one, Kardashian later told detectives, addressed her “with a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. That ring from West, which the influencer had shown off extensively on social media, was estimated to be worth four million dollars. The intruders then tied her up, gagged her and carried her into the bathroom. Three men meanwhile kept watch at the reception, with one waiting at the wheel of a getaway car. The entire robbery lasted around 10 minutes. Kardashian’s frequent posts about her wealth, personal life and whereabouts may have facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. Ait Khedache later told investigators that the job had been “easy”, and nothing like a regular armed robbery. In addition to the ring, which featured a near-flawless 18.88-carat diamond, the group made off with several more pieces of gold and diamond jewellery, including a gold Rolex watch. One of the alleged robbers, Yunice Abbas, now 71, fleeing the scene on a bicycle, dropped a diamond-encrusted cross worth 30,000 euros, which was found by a passer-by a few hours later. The suspected thieves lost a few more items while on the run, but the bulk of the bounty has never been found and is believed to have been sold in Belgium. Abbas later wrote a book, called “I kidnapped Kim Kardashian”, despite also claiming that he was just one of the lookouts without laying eyes on the star. Another suspect, 69-year-old Didier Dubreucq, also came to the scene by bike and is accused of having been in Kardashian’s room, which he denies. The ageing suspects had, according to prosecutors, hoped to make a criminal comeback with the heist. The suspects were identified mostly thanks to their DNA. Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another, 80-year-old Pierre Bouianere, was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately."
Right bookstore in right place — the success story of Waterstones,https://www.kbc.co.ke/right-bookstore-in-right-place-the-success-story-of-waterstones/,2025-04-19T09:53:55+03:00,"Books,bookstores","From high-end urban streets to picturesque suburbs, Waterstones stands as one of Britain’s most iconic bookstore brands. Yet only a decade ago, it was on the brink of bankruptcy, squeezed by the menacing rise of e-reading. Its revival is largely credited to one man who remains steadfast in his mantra — placing the right bookstore in the right place. As both the managing director of Waterstones and CEO of Barnes & Noble in the United States, two major bookstore chains on two continents, James Daunt is a man of deep conviction when it comes to physical bookstores. “Bookstores are for everyone,” he said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at Waterstones’ flagship store on London’s Piccadilly on Thursday. “That’s an incredible strength as a retailer — you appeal to everyone, not just to women, not just to men, not just to young, not just to old. It’s a place to come to for pleasure.” Daunt left a career at J.P. Morgan to open his first bookstore on London’s Marylebone High Street in 1990. That original Daunt Books location has since become one of the city’s most beloved places for book lovers — now also a popular spot among Chinese visitors inspired by posts on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu, or “rednote.” In 2011, Daunt brought that same independent spirit to Waterstones at a time when digital readers like Amazon’s Kindle were poised to render traditional bookstores obsolete. One of his first acts was to prove that wrong. With a belief that each store should reflect its own character, Daunt delegated more autonomy to store managers, scrapping the same layouts and promotional plans and allowing individual shops to decide which books to stock and how to display them. “We empower our booksellers, each store, to do whatever is sensible for its location,” Daunt explained. “It’s the vocational commitment to good bookselling that’s allowing us to run these wonderful stores.” Another major shift came when Daunt ended the longstanding practice of publishers paying for guaranteed shelf placement — a model that often resulted in unsold and returned stock. Instead, Waterstones handed the decision back to its booksellers and their customers. By 2023, only about 9 percent of books were being returned to publishers, down dramatically from 30 to 40 percent in previous years. Barnes & Noble has since adopted similar reforms. After weathering the disruption of e-readers, bookstores today face a new challenge: distraction from social media. Still, Daunt remains optimistic. “When I grew up, we were told we’d never read again because all we would do is watch television, and it was making our eyes ‘square,'” he said. “Now we’re applying that same narrative to the iPad, the iPhone, social media. But we now have more bookstores than we ever had — publishers are publishing more.” He gestured to the headquarters of major publishers near the Thames. “You walk into a gleaming marble building, the most expensive offices in London. Is that because nobody’s reading anymore? No. More and more people are reading with every passing year.” Books, Daunt argued, remain central to culture, which is fueling creativity, shaping movies and ideas, and thriving through new forms of engagement. “When I started, we used to have bestsellers once or twice a year. Now it’s once a month, once a week. But I’m always told nobody’s reading anymore.” “TikTok has been an astonishing medium to convey the energy and experience of our stores,” he said. “These young kids have done that brilliantly. We’ve become a venue for the social media encouragement of reading. It’s propelled bestsellers in a way almost nothing else has done.” For Daunt, bookstores are always a place in everyone’s childhood memory. “When you’re in your twenties, it’s part of courtship — ‘What are you reading?’ ‘What am I reading?’ — It’s a physical space in which it’s just lovely to be.” “If you put really good bookstores in front of people, they will buy more books. You’ll see more people reading on the Tube, on the train, in the bus — wherever it might be.” Looking abroad, Daunt recently visited Chengdu, capital of southwest China’s Sichuan Province, and found fresh inspiration. “The physical spaces, the architecture, the design, the presentation, and the fluidity with which it was being done were exceptional,” he said. “We borrowed quite a lot of those things and use them today in Waterstones.” “Remember, not long ago, everyone said it was only going to be e-reading. No physical books. Too heavy to carry. But once we got our energy back and our confidence back, we started selling lots more.”"

Celebrating Easter and its various traditions,https://www.kbc.co.ke/celebrating-easter-and-its-various-traditions/,2025-04-18T10:39:09+03:00,"culture,Easter","Christianity and Good Friday Good Friday is a significant day of observance for Christians around the world as it marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. On this day, Christians commemorate the death of Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to save humanity from sin and reconcile them with God. For Christians, Good Friday is a day of solemn reflection and repentance, as they remember the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It is a day to meditate on the immense love and mercy of God for sending his only Son to die for the sins of humanity. The Way of the Cross For the Catholic Church, it is the day when popular activities such as The Way of the Cross take place. Good Friday is a part of the Holy Week, which begins with Palm Sunday, followed by Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and culminates in Easter Sunday, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Way of the Cross, also known as the Stations of the Cross, is a traditional Catholic devotion that commemorates the events leading up to and including the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The devotion consists of 14 stations, each representing a different event or moment in the story of Jesus’ journey to his death on the cross. The stations typically include: Jesus is condemned to death
Jesus takes up his cross
Jesus falls for the first time
Jesus meets his mother, Mary
Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross
Veronica wipes the face of Jesus
Jesus falls for the second time
Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
Jesus falls for the third time
Jesus is stripped of his garments
Jesus is nailed to the cross
Jesus dies on the cross
Jesus is taken down from the cross
Jesus is placed in the tomb The Way of the Cross is typically prayed during the season of Lent, especially on Fridays, and is often used as a way to reflect on the sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. It is a solemn and contemplative devotion that can help deepen one’s understanding and appreciation of the Christian faith. The Easter Bunny Away from Christianity, in countries like the United States and countries in Europe like Germany, Easter, as a whole and not just Good Friday, comes with a different celebration; the Easter Bunny. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, the Easter bunny is a celebrated character in Western Easter celebrations. On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter Bunny might have left behind. The mythical figure, the hare, is rooted in European prehistoric, Pagan and Greek traditions. Spending time with family For most Kenyans, however, it is also a day to spend time with family, either by travelling upcountry, enjoying a holiday away from home or at home. If you intend to visit any of Kenya’s national parks this long weekend, the Kenya Wildlife Service has advised that bookings be made early as they roll-out the “Easter Moto Moto in Kenya Parks” campaign. Happy Easter!"
Mulatu Astatke: long journey for the ‘father of Ethio-jazz’,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mulatu-astatke-long-journey-for-the-father-of-ethio-jazz/,2025-04-18T08:32:05+03:00,"Ethio-Jazz,ETHIOPIA","Mulatu Astatke struggled for decades before his name became associated worldwide with a musical genre and he was finally born as the father of Ethio-jazz. Now despite that long journey and his 81 years of age, the Ethiopian music legend cannot even “think about retirement”. A one-man band, equally at home with the vibraphone and the conga, a Cuban drum, he created a unique musical blend in the 1960s, a mix of traditional Ethiopian music, funk brass, Afro-beat, and Latin jazz. “Ethio-jazz is a musical genre which puts the whole world together and makes them one,” the octogenarian with a salt-and-pepper moustache told AFP in a recent interview. The masenqo, a traditional Ethiopian single-stringed instrument played with a bow, features alongside the guitar and the trumpet in his performances. “This is what I want to do, bring the world together around music,” said the composer and trained percussionist in a low voice inside his jazz club African Jazz Village, where he still performs near Addis Ababa’s famous Meskel Square. His music is intended to pay homage to those he calls the “bush people”, the rural Ethiopian populations whose dance and music have had a considerable influence on his work and who, according to him, are “not recognized enough”. “The people who invented the masenqo, those who invented the krar (an Ethiopian stringed instrument similar to the lyre), they are the ones who invented Mulatu,” he said. “Tezeta” — “nostalgia” in Amharic, the Ethiopian national language — is one of the composer’s best-known songs, a sensual and catchy ballad where the saxophone and piano echo each other. But in Mulatu’s life, there is no nostalgia.

– Crossing the wilderness –
Mulatu Astatke was born in 1943 in Jimma, about 350 kilometers southwest of the capital Addis Ababa. As a teenager, his parents sent him to study in Britain. “In high school, all I wanted to be was an engineer or a pilot,” he said, smiling. But the drama and music classes he received led him to change his path. In the late 1950s, he enrolled at Trinity College of Music in London to study clarinet and composition. He then headed to New York and Boston, where he became the first African student to attend the Berkeley College of Music. Mulatu, who immediately declared that he did not want to “talk politics” in the interview, returned to Ethiopia to participate in the vibrant Addis Ababa music scene at the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. He would become one of the central figures of “swinging Addis”. But the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie and the rise to power of the military-Marxist Derg regime in 1974 changed the situation. Western music and culture were censored. It was a journey through the wilderness for Mulatu, who claims to have “struggled” during this period as a music teacher. Recognition and success came in 1998 with the release of the “Ethiopiques” collection, which reissued the musical gems of Swinging Addis. Album number four is dedicated to Mulatu. His career then took a spectacular leap in 2005 thanks to the film “Broken Flowers” by American director Jim Jarmusch, which featured four of his compositions on its soundtrack. With this late-arriving international recognition, Mulatu has no plans to “retire,” unlike Mahmoud Ahmed, another Ethio-jazz legend, who gave his final concert in January. Mulatu is returning from a tour of the United States and will perform in September at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. “I have an album which will be released this year. It is called Mulatu plays Mulatu,” he said with a big smile. “But 40, 50 years I’ve been struggling. It took me 40 years to reach world recognition — I am not going to stop now.”"
Chinese film week kicks off in Cambodia,https://www.kbc.co.ke/chinese-film-week-kicks-off-in-cambodia/,2025-04-18T07:50:03+03:00,"Cambodia,China","The 2025 Chinese Film Week kicked off on Thursday, bringing Cambodian people the best of recent Chinese films across various genres and themes. The event, which opened with the animated film “I Am What I Am 2,” will run through April 21.
At the opening ceremony, Phoeurng Sackona, the Cambodian minister of culture and fine arts, said Cambodia and China have expanded their collaboration in the film industry through various projects. The event will be a great opportunity for both sides to share creativity, strengthen friendship, and promote solidarity as they work together to build a Cambodia-China community with a shared future, she added. Zhang Xuxia, deputy director of China Film Archive, said that the Chinese animated blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” has been very popular in Cambodia. Premiered on March 25, the film is available both in its original Chinese audio and a Khmer dubbed version, showcasing the cultural exchanges between the two countries. Zhang said that the Chinese side looks forward to further promoting in-depth cooperation with Cambodia in various aspects of the film industry and contributing to the strengthening of the iron-clad friendship between the two peoples. A total of six films will be screened during this year’s event, including I Am What I Am 2, Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms, Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force, Detective Chinatown 1900, A Tapestry of a Legendary Land, and Big World.

Hollywood’s fading charm in China — and why U.S. tariffs are making it worse,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hollywoods-fading-charm-in-china-and-why-u-s-tariffs-are-making-it-worse/,2025-04-17T20:58:41+03:00,"China,Film","Once the king of China’s silver screen, Hollywood now finds itself sidelined, as local blockbusters surge and Washington’s tariffs against the rest of the world add fuel to shifting audience sentiment. According to data released this week, Chinese animated feature “Ne Zha 2” has scored a thunderous success, raking in 15.2 billion yuan (about 2.11 billion U.S. dollars) at China’s box office in just 12 weeks. In stark contrast, the top-performing American film so far this year, “A Minecraft Movie” from Warner Bros., has just crossed 150 million yuan and failed to break into China’s top 10 films of 2025. That continues a sobering trend: 2024 marked the second consecutive year in which no Hollywood title cracked the one-billion-yuan mark, a symbolic threshold once routinely surpassed. The sharp contrast highlights the deepening decline of Hollywood’s influence in the world’s second-largest movie market. Analysts say U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions are only accelerating the slide.

CREATIVE DECLINE Industry data tells the story. American movies’ share of China’s annual box office revenue has plunged from 36 percent in 2018 and 30 percent in 2019 to just 14 percent in 2024, according to figures from box office tracker Maoyan, obtained by Xinhua. That fading influence extends beyond box office numbers. “American blockbusters aren’t drawing much of a crowd anymore,” wrote one Weibo user nicknamed “SurfaceMe,” blaming a mix of lackluster quality and declining favorability amid tariff and trade tensions. “The appeal, emotional resonance, and cultural impact of Hollywood films are fading among Chinese audiences,” said Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association. “Creatively, Hollywood has grown conservative, leaning too heavily on Marvel and other franchise fare. The visual spectacle remains, but viewers are experiencing aesthetic fatigue. And on a deeper level, American stories often feel disconnected from Chinese life, making it harder to generate empathy or emotional response.” According to a China Film News report, original Hollywood productions accounted for just 18.6 percent of all U.S. studio releases in 2024, a dramatic decline from 40.9 percent in 2000. In contrast, sequels, reboots, adaptations and spinoffs now account for 81.4 percent. This cost-efficient but creatively cautious model has dampened Chinese viewers’ expectations for high-quality cinematic content, it says.

DWINDLING FAVORABILITY But Hollywood’s creative slump is only part of the picture. Industry insiders point to another force hastening its fall in China: the long shadow of Washington’s aggressive tariff policy and its downstream effects on public sentiment. Film is part of the broader U.S. services sector, where the United States has traditionally maintained a significant trade surplus with China. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. service exports to China grew more than eightfold between 2001 and 2023, with the annual surplus peaking at nearly 40 billion dollars. Film and other IP-driven content have long been a key part of that advantage. “U.S. politicians fixated on manufacturing trade deficits are overlooking the billions America has earned through services,” said Ming Jinwei, a Beijing-based commentator and widely followed blogger. He warned that weaponizing tariffs could backfire by undermining America’s winning sectors. “Irrational U.S. tariffs could trigger a chain reaction, as IP-driven cultural industries are ‘cross-media, integrated and long-chained,'” said Chen Xuguang, director of the Institute of Film, Television and Theatre at Peking University. Washington’s tariff policies risk triggering a ripple effect, with audiences drifting away from Hollywood films and potentially other U.S. cultural exports tied to major IP, he said. REPERCUSSIONS Washington’s trade restrictions and tariff escalations against China are already being felt in the reception of American cultural exports here. Franchises like Transformers, Fast & Furious and even Marvel, once guaranteed box office juggernauts, are now performing inconsistently — or outright poorly — in China. “It’s been rare for an American film to cross the 100 million yuan mark in China in recent years — unless it’s something truly special,” said Dong Wenxin, a film critic and manager of a cinema in Jinan, Shandong Province. “They’re getting beaten not just by Japanese anime but also by European arthouse and regional Asian surprises.” Tastes are shifting. Japanese animation continues to draw steady crowds, while European and Southeast Asian films are gaining ground. This year’s surprise hits, Italy’s “There’s Still Tomorrow” and Britain’s “National Theatre Live: Prima Facie,” have exceeded expectations. Thailand’s “How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies” became a breakout sleeper last year. Looking ahead, Dong said China’s film market is likely to forge even closer ties beyond the United States to meet the increasingly diverse audience needs. And Beijing is already moving in that direction. A recent film agreement with Spain calls for deepening collaboration on co-productions, film festivals and mutual screenings, signaling that China is broadening its cultural partnerships. The irony is stark: Washington’s trade restrictions and tariff moves, designed to protect American industries, may end up crippling one of the country’s most impactful exports — its cultural influence, analysts say. “U.S. tariffs don’t just tax goods — they tax appeal,” said Ming. “And in today’s global entertainment economy, once that appeal wanes, even the strongest cultural influence may have to struggle to endure.”"
Mejja takes number one spot on YouTube music,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mejja-takes-number-one-spot-on-youtube-music/,2025-04-17T15:54:59+03:00,"Entertainment,music","Well-known Gengetone artist, Mejja, is currently trending in the number one spot on YouTube following the release of his new single, “Ya Mwisho.” With the views currently at 423k, at the time of publishing, the song blends Mejja’s unique gengetone signature of storytelling and humour.

There was no donation made to Grammys by government – Dennis Itumbi says,https://www.kbc.co.ke/there-was-no-donation-made-to-grammy-by-government-dennis-itumbi-says/,2025-04-17T13:20:28+03:00,"Creative economy,Entertainment","The Head of Special Projects in the President’s office, Dennis Itumbi, has clarified the government’s position on the controversial subject of the Grammys. He was speaking in a recent roundtable discussion that featured creatives such as Timothy Ndegwa (Njugush) and Cleophas Malala, Kennedy Odhiambo (Crazy Kennar) and plawright and producer Gathoni Kimuyu. While countering an argument made by Cleophas Malala, Mr Itumbi said that the Kenya Kwanza government had not made a donation to the Recording Academy, the body responsible for the Grammy Awards in the USA. “There was, absolutely, no donation made by the Kenyan government to the Grammy Awards,” he said. “The Kenyan government, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa lobbied to have the Recording Academy headquarters in Africa, and Kenya, like all the other four countries, bid.” He was referring to the Recording Academy’s mission to expand its presence in countries across Africa and the Middle East. The organisation had announced this decision in June 2024 after it embarked on a mission in 2023 to meet music creators and learn more about the music scenes from around the world. Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, explained at the time that the initiative was a way for the 67-year-old institution to change. “The way music has been going, the way that the world is going, it’s becoming smaller, technology is allowing us to do more, and we’re seeing these really thriving, vibrant music scenes maturing and developing all around the world, and the music ecosystem has just evolved. It’s just changed,” he said. While explaining the bidding process, Mr Itumbi said the institution would return the money should Kenya lose the bid, clarifying that it was not a donation but part of the bidding process. “Part of the bid is to pay KSh. 500M and the bid has not yet been decided,” he said. “On February 27 and 28, there were delegations to Los Angeles office of the Recording Academy. If we lose the bid, of course, the money is returned.” Kenya’s bid for the Grammys first made headlines in 2024 when President William Ruto made the revelation at a town hall meeting at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) to commemorate the Hustler’s second anniversary. The event was intended to emphasise his administration’s commitment to strengthening Kenya’s creative industry and positioning the country as a global entertainment hub. “We have already paid the Ksh. 500 million. This is not something we are planning to do; it’s already done,” President Ruto said at the time, referring to Kenya’s bid. “I’m confident that the gentleman here from the Grammys can confirm that we’re on the right track to securing Kenya’s position in this exciting initiative.”"
