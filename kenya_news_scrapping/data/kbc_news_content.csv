Three suspects in Ruto shoe incident released without charges,https://www.kbc.co.ke/three-suspects-in-ruto-shoe-incident-released-without-charges/,2025-05-06T11:03:10+03:00,,"Three individuals who were arrested for allegedly hurling a shoe at President William Ruto during a public event in Migori have been released without charges after investigations revealed the act was not intentional. The incident occurred on May 5, as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha, Kuria West Constituency, as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County. Security officers moved swiftly to arrest three individuals suspected to be involved. However, after a thorough review of multiple video recordings, investigators concluded that there was no clear intent to target the Head of State. A senior security official, who spoke to KBC on condition of anonymity, said the video footage showed one person holding a shoe, possibly mimicking others who were using their phones to record the event. According to the investigators, someone reportedly complained that the shoe was blocking their view, prompting another individual to knock it aside. The shoe was inadvertently propelled toward the President. Local leaders, including members of the clergy, condemned the incident, describing it as disrespectful and shameful. They urged the public to maintain decorum during public events and to support ongoing development initiatives in the region."
"Facts don’t lie, security is improving – CS Murkomen",https://www.kbc.co.ke/facts-dont-lie-security-is-improving-cs-murkomen/,2025-05-06T10:56:17+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has defended the government’s record on security since he took charge of the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, citing tangible improvements. In response to criticism regarding his management of security issues, Murkomen asserts that all available data indicates an improving security situation in most parts of the country, particularly in areas prone to bandit attacks. “Mkiniona, mnaona kama mimi ni mtu wa kucheza na mambo ya banditry? Forget about these stories watu wanaandika sijui ooh Kipchumba hii, Kipchumba hiyo. Give us the statistics and the numbers,” he stated. “Nimekuwa waziri wa usalama 5 months pekee. In the first three months, tumepunguza mambo ya banditry. Sio kwa sababu Kipchumba amefanya kazi, and I know I will not even be given credit. It’s because there are men and women, police officers mpaka NPR, wenye wamejitolea na wako kwa ground and we support them,” the CS explained. According to Murkomen, the 2025 quarter one security report confirms this with numbers indicating a significant decrease in cases of banditry and stock theft. He pointed out that between January and March 2025, deaths from banditry dropped significantly to 21, down from 58 during the same period in 2024. He said reported stock theft cases also fell from 263 to 167, while livestock thefts decreased from 8,557 to 4,935 over the same periods. “I have very clear instructions from the President, and I know where we are going,” said the CS. He reiterated his commitment to ensuring that, under his leadership, security agencies will have the necessary support to eliminate cattle rustling. “Tuko kwa kauli ya mwisho ya kumalizana na mambo ya banditry. Tukiingia serikalini, Laikipia, Baringo South na sehemu nyingi ya Kerio Valley watoto hawakuwa wanaenda shule. Sehemu nyingi kulikuwa na shida kubwa sana,” he said. He also reiterated his belief that certain individuals have been profiting from insecurity in specific areas of the country, contributing to long-standing security challenges. He warned that this will not be tolerated. “Naelewa mambo ya banditry sana. Nili-grow up tukiwa na hii mambo ya bundiki. That’s why ukiona napiga kelele, I am speaking from experience. I don’t support arming of any community no matter the challenges the people face because we want to sort out the problems of Kerio Valley,” he stated, urging leaders to support efforts aimed at fostering peace."

ICJ Kenya hails court ruling declaring WorldCoin’s biometric data collection illegal,https://www.kbc.co.ke/icj-kenya-hails-court-ruling-declaring-worldcoins-biometric-data-collection-illegal/,2025-05-06T09:19:06+03:00,"ICJ,Worldcoin","The International Commission of Jurists – Kenyan Section (ICJ Kenya) has welcomed a High Court ruling that found the collection, processing, and transfer of biometric data by WorldCoin in Kenya to be unconstitutional and unlawful. In a statement, ICJ Kenya Chairperson Protas Saende lauded the judgment by Lady Justice Roselyne Aburili, describing it as an affirmation of the right to privacy in the digital era. “The judgment rightly underscores that even in the digital age, constitutional rights especially the right to privacy under Article 31 of the Constitution must be upheld,” said Sande. The ruling stems from a public interest case filed by Katiba Institute challenging the legality of WorldCoin’s operations in Kenya, with ICJ Kenya participating as an interested party. Sande noted that Tools for Humanity, the company behind WorldCoin, violated the Data Protection Act by failing to conduct a mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and collecting personal data without valid consent. According to ICJ Kenya, the court determined that the company induced Kenyans to surrender their biometric data, including iris scans, by offering cryptocurrency worth 55 US Dollars, thereby breaching the principle of informed consent. “The Court affirmed that WorldCoin commenced data collection without valid consent from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and without conducting the required DPIA, in breach of Sections 25, 26, 29, 30, and 31 of the Data Protection Act, 2019,” Sande stated. ICJ Kenya also hailed orders issued by the court which include, prohibition of WorldCoin from collecting personal data from Kenyans and quashing of its decision to collect such data without a DPIA. The courts also ordered permanent deletion of unlawfully collected data under the supervision of the ODPC within 7 days and the revocation of the Respondents’ data processing certificate. “This ruling is a powerful precedent not just for Kenya, but globally affirming that rights must remain paramount in technological innovation,” said Sande."

The partnership, which also involves Ekaterra Global Operations the corporate entity behind Lipton comes nearly two years after initial discussions between President William Ruto and Lipton’s CEO Nathalie Roos in May 2023. Speaking during the ceremony, Education Cabinet Secretary (CS) Julius Migos Ogamba hailed the initiative as a significant step towards aligning education with industry needs, adding that the agreement will be a major boost for tea farmers in the region, who stand to benefit from enhanced production techniques and access to global best practices. “This is the culmination of a long but productive journey. Our farmers will now have access to cutting-edge knowledge and skills that will enhance tea quality and increase yields.” Said Ogamba He said the Tea Academy will be based at the University of Kabianga, which is strategically located in the heart of Kenya’s tea-growing belt and will serve as a hub for farmer training, research, and innovation focused on sustainable tea production and climate resilience. “The Academy will expose our farmers to technologies that address climate change, promote low-carbon practices, and improve productivity. It is an excellent opportunity for farmers to benefit from the expertise of one of the world’s leading tea companies,” added Ogamba He said the collaboration is designed not only to boost productivity but also to increase the earnings of smallholder farmers, adding that by adopting modern and sustainable practices, farmers are expected to command better prices on both local and international markets. The Cabinet Secretary, Ogamba, emphasized the government’s broader vision for higher education institutions to become engines of innovation and development, adding that the Tea Academy will play a critical role in helping Kenya maintain its reputation as a leading global exporter of high-quality tea. “The future and sustainability of our universities depend on strategic partnerships such as this. We expect institutions to engage in cutting-edge research and commercialize innovations that can transform industries,” he said. With implementation expected to commence immediately, stakeholders expressed optimism that the Tea Academy would begin operations by the end of 2025, with its first cohort of farmers and researchers enrolled shortly thereafter. Kericho Governor Dr. Erick Mutai, who also graced the occasion, commended the government for the establishment of the Lipton Tea Innovation and Technology Academy (LTITA) at the University of Kabianga, saying it will drive cutting-edge research, innovation, and value addition in tea production, ultimately boosting farmers’ earnings. “As a County Government, we welcome the inaugural academy which we expect will train over 3,000 Kenyans annually to build globally competitive talent for the tea industry.” Said Dr. Mutai."
ICJ throws out Sudan genocide case against UAE,https://www.kbc.co.ke/icj-throws-out-sudan-genocide-case-against-uae/,2025-05-05T19:51:00+03:00,"Mohamed Hamdan Daglo,Rapid Support Forces (RSF)","The top United Nations court on Monday threw out Sudan’s case against the United Arab Emirates over alleged complicity in genocide during the brutal Sudanese civil war. Sudan had taken the UAE to the International Court of Justice over its alleged support for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying it was contributing to a genocide — accusations denied by the Emiratis. But the ICJ said it “manifestly lacked” jurisdiction to rule on the case and threw out it out. When the UAE signed up to the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes. This reservation meant the ICJ did not have the power to intervene in the case. A UAE official hailed the judges’ ruling. “This decision is a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless,” Reem Ketait, deputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE foreign ministry, said in a statement to AFP. Before the ruling, Ketait had accused Sudan of lodging the case in a “cynical attempt to divert attention from their own brutal record of atrocities against Sudanese civilians”. Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The war has triggered what aid agencies call the world’s largest displacement, and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment. The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations. The ICJ said it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute”. “The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,” the court added. As the court found that it lacked jurisdiction to go forward with Sudan’s legal action, it did not rule on the fundamental merits of the case. The court noted that: “Whether or not states have accepted the jurisdiction of the court… they are required to comply with their obligations (to the Genocide Convention).” Countries also “remain responsible for acts attributable to them which are contrary to their international obligations”. A handful of pro-Sudan protesters staged a demonstration outside the Peace Palace, the seat of the ICJ in The Hague, shouting and brandishing banners including one that read “UAE kills Sudan”. “We feel completely disappointed… We only ask for justice,” said one protester, Hisham Fadl Akasha, a 57-year-old engineer. The Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights (RWCHR), based in Montreal, called the ICJ’s decision “a travesty”. “Today, one can only feel shocked -– if not betrayed -– by the ongoing level of indifference and impunity in the face of another genocide that is being effectively silenced and sanitised,” RWCHR founder Irwin Cotler said in a statement. – ‘Reparations’ demanded –
During hearings on the case last month, Sudan’s acting justice minister Muawia Osman told the court the “ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF”. “The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” said Osman. Khartoum had urged the ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war. While the ICJ has rejected Sudan’s case, the bloody conflict in Sudan shows no sign of easing. On Sunday, the RSF struck Port Sudan, the army said, in the first attack on the seat of the army-aligned government during the country’s two-year war."
Romania’s pro-EU premier announces his resignation,https://www.kbc.co.ke/romanias-pro-eu-premier-announces-his-resignation/,2025-05-05T19:41:35+03:00,"George Simion,NATO","Romania’s pro-EU Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu on Monday announced his resignation, deepening political turmoil a day after a far-right candidate topped the first round of a tense presidential vote rerun. EU critic George Simion topped Sunday’s first round in the EU and NATO member bordering war-torn Ukraine, while the ruling coalition’s candidate narrowly lost out to Bucharest’s mayor for the second spot. Ciolacu’s resignation comes just two weeks before the second round scheduled for May 18 — closely watched by Brussels and Washington — worsening political turmoil in the eastern European country. “I have proposed to my colleagues to leave the governing coalition, which implicitly leads to my resignation as prime minister,” Ciolacu, 57, told reporters after a meeting of his Social Democrats party. “We saw how Romanians voted yesterday (Sunday) which means that the ruling coalition has no legitimacy, at least in this formula,” he added. He said that his party’s ministers would discuss with their coalition partners to decide whether they will remain in the government on an interim basis. Simion, who leads the nationalist AUR party, gained almost 41 percent of votes, double the score of pro-EU independent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan. Dan narrowly edged out the ruling coalition’s candidate Crin Antonescu. A far-right victory in the second round could mark a shift in the country’s foreign policy. Simion, a fan of US President Donald Trump, has criticised “Brussels’ unelected bureaucrats”, accusing them of having meddled in the Romanian elections. In December, Romania’s constitutional court scrapped the ballot after far-right politician Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round. The annulment followed allegations of Russian interference and a massive TikTok campaign that emerged in favour of Georgescu. Simion has called the annulment “a coup d’etat”."
Working with Raila enables us to concentrate on service delivery – Ruto,https://www.kbc.co.ke/working-with-raila-enables-us-to-concentrate-on-service-delivery-ruto/,2025-05-05T17:54:34+03:00,,"President William Ruto has stated that collaborating with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga enables his administration to prioritize service delivery and national unity over political rivalry. During a development tour of Migori County, Ruto emphasized that his partnership with Raila and the ODM party is centred on putting the interests of Kenyans first, fostering political cohesion, and addressing pressing issues such as the cost of living and youth unemployment. “Tulikubaliana na Raila Odinga ya kwamba hatutaki siasa ya chuki, ukabila na migawanyiko. Sasa ni wakati wa kuungana na tukiungana si kwa sababu ya mambo ya kibinafsi. Tunaungana ili tuweze kupanga mambo ya maendeleo. Mambo ya siasa itakuja baadaye,” he stated. President Ruto asserted that opposition leaders would not succeed in dragging the government into a political environment characterised by hatred, division, and tribalism. He expressed his commitment to implementing programmes and projects aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans and confirmed that he would remain steadfast in this mission. He called on his critics to propose alternative development plans, arguing that it is unwise to rely on outdated and detrimental political practices. The President also expressed confidence in Kenyans’ ability to recognise development-oriented leaders as opposed to those who incite hate, division, and tribalism. “Kenyans want to know what your plan is. Must Go is not enough. Must Go is not an agenda,” he remarked. These comments were made on the second day of his development tour in Migori County, where he was accompanied by Migori County Governor Ochilo Ayacko, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs. He underscored that this is not the time for political manoeuvring but rather for serving the people. Regarding sugar farming, President Ruto announced that the government is commercialising sugar companies to enhance their operational efficiency. He explained that this initiative would ensure timely payments for farmers and workers, with growers also set to receive bonuses. “We will put in place at Sony a management style that has succeeded at Mumias Sugar Company. It pays farmers and workers on time,” he said. Additionally, the President highlighted the government’s commitment to reforming other crucial areas of the agricultural sector to boost profitability in farming. He pointed out that the affordable fertiliser programme, which has reduced fertiliser costs, has already resulted in increased agricultural productivity and output. On education, he noted that the government is enacting bold reforms to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has equal access to learning and opportunities for success. President Ruto highlighted the recruitment of 76,000 teachers, with an additional 20,000 planned for later this year, alongside the rollout of a new university funding model to support disadvantaged students. Regarding employment, the President noted that the government is investing in labour-intensive programmes, such as modern markets and affordable housing, aimed at creating job opportunities for the youth. In addition, the government is establishing digital hubs and facilitating job placements abroad. On infrastructure, the President stated that the government has allocated sufficient resources to complete 18 roads that had been stalled in Migori County. He also mentioned that the government is making strategic investments to unlock the potential of Lake Victoria, which possesses significant resources that can generate jobs, enhance food production, and stimulate the region’s economy. In Rongo, President Ruto inspected the construction of the Riosir Market, which will accommodate more than 300 traders. He also commissioned St Paul’s Rongo Mixed Day Secondary School. Later, President Ruto presided over the groundbreaking of the Alara Nyambija Livestock Training Institute in Awendo, which will support livestock farming in the county. The new institute will be powered by a reliable and affordable electricity supply, serving over 25,000 households in the area. The President also launched the construction of the Muhuru Bay Pier, aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and significantly increasing earnings for local fishermen. Additionally, President Ruto flagged off the KSh1.9 billion Migori Last Mile Connectivity project, which is set to connect 25,000 households in Migori County by December 2025.

"Kenyan youth declare bold commitment to forest conservation, green economy ahead of COP 30",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyan-youth-declare-bold-commitment-to-forest-conservation-green-economy-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-05-05T17:30:09+03:00,"AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F),COP 30","Young environmental leaders from across Kenya have issued a powerful declaration reaffirming their central role in the country’s green transition and forest conservation agenda. The declaration was made during of a three-day AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) National Youth Workshop held in Kitui County under the theme “From Science to Youth Action for Sustainable Forestry.” Conducted by the African Forest Forum in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the workshop is part of the continental build-up to COP 30, scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where African youth will present their unified voice and policy recommendations on forestry, climate action, and sustainable development. It provided a space for youth to co-develop practical solutions, enhance their skills in conservation and ecopreneurship, and advocacy in national and international forestry discourse. The youth declaration outlines the challenges facing forest ecosystems in Kenya, ranging from climate change, limited inclusion of youth in policy-making, deforestation, to lack of access to funding and technical training. Despite these obstacles, young participants reaffirmed their readiness to lead through green innovation, community-based conservation, and forest-based entrepreneurship. Their proposed solutions include tree nursery enterprises, digital storytelling for forest advocacy, carbon credit initiatives, climate-smart agroforestry, as well as timber and non-timber forest product enterprises and ecotourism. “Young people are not just future leaders they are today’s drivers of sustainability and innovation; We are ready to take charge in ensuring that our forests thrive while creating inclusive economic opportunities that benefit our communities and the planet.” the declaration states in part. The AfricanYouth4Forests (AY4F) initiative represents a dynamic intersection between Africa’s verdant forests and its vibrant youth population that is four times larger than Europe’s and as ripe with potential. By fusing traditional wisdom with science and digital tools, AY4F empowers youth aged 18–30 to transform environmental aspirations into practical actions that protect biodiversity, mitigate climate impacts, and generate green livelihoods. The national workshop was aimed at translating scientific and indigenous knowledge into youth-led action, equipping youth with tools for sustainable forest management and conservation, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the green economy, and strengthening youth advocacy for policy influence and decision-making. Despite being among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Africa’s youth are uniquely positioned to lead the green transition. Their digital proficiency, innovation, and grassroots knowledge and networks provides them the advantage to implement nature-based solutions at both local and global levels. Yet, their voices are often underrepresented in sustainability debates and policy forums. “Our forests are not just natural resources; they’re our inheritance. And it’s our duty as youth to protect and restore them with both urgency and creativity,” said Esther Maina, one of the participants who is also the National Coordinator, Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network, a youth-led membership organization that galvanizes youth action to respond to pressing environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. “Through the AfricanYouth4Forests project, we are connecting science and traditional knowledge with action, helping young people understand their role in forest governance and climate action. By integrating these, we create a holistic foundation for decision-making, innovation, and stewardship. This fusion empowers the youth to take informed action, preserve ecosystems, and design adaptive solutions that are both contextually relevant and scientifically sound, ensuring forests remain a source of livelihood, identity, and ecological balance for generations to come”, said Dr. Mutta, representing the AFF Executive Secretary-CEO, Prof. Labode Popoola. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Prof. Anders Roos and co-facilitator said that the AY4F initiative is more than a training – it’s a launchpad for youth-driven transformation. He added: “Through scientific understanding and creative problem-solving, African youth are being equipped to design forest solutions rooted in both innovation and local realities.” The declaration issued strong calls to action: urging the Kenyan government to integrate youth in forestry governance, expand youth-focused green financing and training programs, and embed sustainable forest education across the curriculum particularly in tertiary education. The private sector, NGOs and development partners were urged to support youth with mentorship, technical support, storytelling platforms, and resources for enterprise incubation. Speaking at the opening session, KEFRI Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jane Njuguna said that forests are at the heart of Kenya’s environmental resilience and socio-economic future, noting that empowering young people to become stewards of our forests is no longer optional but an urgent necessity. “This workshop ensures that the next generation not only understands our forests but also actively shapes how they are governed, restored, and sustained,” stated Dr. Njuguna. Urging the youth to harness forest resources as a source of employment and economic contribution, AFF Consultant Dr. Joshua Cheboiwo, noted that forests are more than just natural treasures but also powerful engines for job creation and economic growth. “We encourage youth to harness the vast opportunities within forestry, from sustainable timber and non-timber products to ecotourism, beekeeping, and green innovation. With creativity and commitment, young people can turn forest resources into thriving enterprises that support livelihoods while protecting the environment for future generations,” Cheboiwo said."

Russia reaffirms Africa ties as strategic priority in push for multipolar world,https://www.kbc.co.ke/russia-reaffirms-africa-ties-as-strategic-priority-in-push-for-multipolar-world/,2025-05-06T00:55:55+03:00,"Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov,Russia–Africa: What’s Next?” Forum","Russia has reaffirmed Africa’s central role in Moscow’s foreign policy, stating that advancing ties with African countries remains an “unconditional priority” as Russia seeks to support the continent’s sovereignty and global influence in a multipolar world. Speaking in a video address at the opening of the fourth “Russia–Africa: What’s Next?” Forum held at MGIMO University in Moscow from April 22 to 26, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that fostering relations between Russia and African countries is an absolute priority in Russian foreign policy. “Russian-African friendship and partnership have a long history: in the past century, our country selflessly helped Africans in their courageous struggle for freedom and independence. Advancing relations with the African countries is among our unconditional priorities, and this approach is enshrined in the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation approved by President Vladimir Putin. We support the Africans’ push to be active players in international affairs. We will continue to help strengthen the continent’s position as an independent centre of power in the emerging multipolar world order.” Lavrov said. He noted that Russian-African relations are on the rise, stating that: “Together with our African friends, we oppose modern practices of neo-colonialism. We believe it is important to combine our efforts in order to create mechanisms for economic ties and international trade services that are beyond Western control.” The week long forum which was was organized by the Council of Young Diplomats of the Russian Foreign Ministry with support from the World Youth Festival Directorate, featured the inaugural Forum of Young Diplomats “Russia–Africa”, 50 young representatives from foreign ministries of over 20 countries. The forum was a unique platform for establishing and strengthening the Russia-Africa dialogue, which facilitates experience exchange among leaders of the new generation on the primary aspects of Russian-African relations. In the a video address Lavrov also noted that Russia and African countries successfully cooperate in trade and economy, implementing joint humanitarian projects. In addition, Russia assists African countries in ensuring their political and economic sovereignty, provides training for qualified African personnel at Russian universities, offering state-funded quotas. Forum participants discussed a wide range of issues, including those related to cooperation in politics, economy, energy, trade, education, and culture. They attended the plenary session, roundtable, expert and panel discussions, brainstorm session, business game, and other events. One of the key Russian-African cooperation tracks is youth policy. During the panel discussion “Aspects of Cultural and Humanitarian Cooperation. Russian Projects for African Youth”, Dmitry Ivanov, Director General of the World Youth Festival Directorate, spoke about the WYF Directorate’s flagship projects and initiatives. “We are building solid cooperation with African countries in youth policy. 60% of Africa’s population is youth aged under 25. In this regard, African is one of the world’s ‘youngest’ continents. It was the WYF 2024, where we witnessed many informal, friendly contacts established between youth from Russia and Africa. The Festival brought together young leaders from 190 countries, including 1,000 people from 51 African countries. On the instruction of the Russian President, festival events will be held in our country annually What’s even more important is that today we are creating a comprehensive system of youth policy experience exchange and involving African youth in projects and opportunities available in Russia.” Dmitry Ivanov noted. Adding that: “We continuously expand the engagement of African youth in forum events in our country, invite them to join the Year-Round Youth Educational Centers, and, of course, share experience and implement a series of joint projects and initiatives with our partners in African countries over 120 of them.” Ivanov invited youth to join Year-Round Youth Educational Centers and the World Youth Festival Assembly, expected to take place in September in Nizhny Novgorod and bring together 1,000 Russian and 1,000 international participants.

This is not limited to trade and investments cooperation, security cooperation, technological cooperation, exchange of high-level visits, and multilateral cooperation, amongst other areas. It is, therefore, important to foster Kenya-Russia cooperation to further enhance the cordial mutual relations and harness new areas for the benefit of our two countries. This could also ensure Kenya’s access to the larger Eurasian market in terms of trade and investments”, noted Nzugwa. He shared that young diplomats are the future of diplomacy, and forums such as the Russia–Africa Forum of Young Diplomats offer a pathway to nurture this and see diplomacy through to the next generation. According to Nzugwa, the forum gave a platform to learn from each other, developing us as young diplomats, creating a more cultural and mutually beneficial diplomatic system, and finally creating a better synergy between Africa and Russia. The Forum also featured participant of the World Youth Festival 2024, which took place in Russia on March 1–7, 2024, bringing together 20,000 young people from 190 countries. The plenary session featured a speech by a foreign partner of the World Youth Festival Directorate, WYF-2024 participant, and CEO of StudEx Group, Tumelo Ramaphosa from South Africa. “I first visited Russia during the World Youth Festival. I think it was a great opportunity for the youth of Russia and the whole world to make their voices heard. Many people learned more about Russia and how to partake in shaping a better world”, said Tumelo Ramaphosa. The discussion “International Information Security: Prospects for Cooperation Between Russia and African Countries” featured Junior Isidro, producer, youth activist, and WYF-2024 participant from Guinea-Bissau. “Russian and African youth share common values, and these must be preserved. Russia can both share much with Africa and also gain from it. The Festival showed the world that Russia is an open and friendly country. I am confident that young people from abroad can live in Russia, create, and develop their projects here. I would advise young people not to be afraid, to believe in themselves, to be independent, and to analyze information correctly. We, the youth, are the leaders of the future. I urge young people to grow together with Russia and not be afraid to express themselves”, shared Junior Isidro. According to Isidro, events like the World Youth Festival unite young people from many countries, allowing them to make new connections and learn about other cultures. “There have always been warm relations between Russia and Egypt, and Africa as a whole. Russia has always adhered to the principle of mutual benefit, aiding Africa, which is very important for the continent. Therefore, I would like to see cooperation between Russia and Africa develop further as it is beneficial for both sides. It is important for young people to learn more about each other. Initiatives like the Forum of Young Diplomats and events organized by the World Youth Festival Directorate strengthen relations and increase mutual understanding between our countries”, said Yossr Ghazy from Egypt, participant of the World Youth Festival. The Forum of Young Diplomats is held as part of the fourth “Russia-Africa: What’s Next?” Forum. Since 2019, the forum has brought together over 1,500 representatives from various countries, including ministers, heads of African diplomatic missions, representatives from Russian ministries and agencies, business, media, and leading scholars in African studies. World Youth Festival The World Youth Festival took place on March 1–7, 2024 in Sirius, according to the Decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the development of international youth cooperation. The WYF-2024 brought together 20,000 young leaders from 190 countries. On the instructions of the President of the Russian Federation, the WYF will be held in Russia on a regular basis – once in six years. Also, every six years 10,000 young people from all over the world will get together at the World Youth Festival Forum, and in between, international themed assemblies for 2,000 participants will be held under the auspices of the WYF. The first Assembly is scheduled to take place in September 2025 in Nizhny Novgorod. Festival events of various formats will be held in Russia annually. According to the instructions of the President of the Russian Federation on the preservation and development of the Festival legacy, the World Youth Festival Directorate continues the work aimed at strengthening international youth cooperation."
"CS Ruku vows to deepen public service reforms, mainstream Article 232",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cs-ruku-vows-to-deepen-public-service-reforms-mainstream-article-232/,2025-05-05T13:35:15+03:00,,"Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Human Capital Development and Special Programmes, Geoffrey Ruku, has reaffirmed his commitment to enhancing public service delivery across the country, with a particular focus on marginalized regions. Speaking at Kanyuambora, Embu County as he conducted citizen participation meetings with the residents, the CS underscored the Ministry’s ongoing nationwide initiative to collect citizen feedback and assess the effectiveness of government service structures. CS Ruku said that the engagements formed part of a broader strategy to accelerate the implementation of Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya, which outlines the core principles and values of public service, including responsiveness, equity, accountability, and citizen participation. “As Cabinet Secretary, I am committed to ensuring that these values are not just aspirational, but reflected in the lived experience of every Kenyan,” he stated. “For far too long, minorities in Kenya have endured underdevelopment and exclusion from the national transformation agenda but this has been reversed during President William Ruto’s tenure.” He added He noted that the interactions also provided an opportunity to review service delivery structures in the area and aimed at decentralizing government services, empowering local leadership, and enhancing transparency. “Feedback confirms that while progress has been made, a lot more need to be done to improve coordination and ensure these public service systems meet the expectations of our people,” he added. On the issue of disaster preparedness and food security, the CS assured the public that the country is developing enough reserves to ensure that no Kenyan will die of hunger. He said his Ministry is working closely with other government agencies to implement proactive disaster mitigation strategies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions prone to drought, flash floods and food shortages. “We are prepared, and we will act early to prevent suffering,” he said. “The government is committed to protecting vulnerable communities from the worst effects of climate-related and other emergencies.” Hon. Ruku praised the administration of President William Ruto for what he described as a historic shift in government investment in arid and semi-arid areas, citing the rollout of key infrastructure and development projects that had previously eluded the region. “As a Ministry, we are working to ensure that these gains are not just sustained but deepened. Our goal is to build a responsive and inclusive public service that upholds the values of the Constitution and delivers tangible outcomes for all citizens,” he said."
"There’s no turning back on deal with Ruto, Raila allies affirm",https://www.kbc.co.ke/theres-no-turning-back-on-deal-with-ruto-raila-allies-affirm/,2025-05-05T13:14:45+03:00,,"Key allies of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have affirmed that there is no turning back on the political deal signed with President William Ruto. The group, led by Minority Leader of the National Assembly Junet Mohamed, Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, and Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi, noted that Ruto and Raila officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) last year establishing a framework for broad-based government cooperation between their parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), and this decision still stands. “This broad-based government, sisi kama watu wa ODM tuli-sign MOU na Rais William Ruto na ten-point agenda. And we will stick by that,” said Junet Mohamed. He criticized a section of ODM leaders who continue to oppose President William Ruto’s administration, stating that their views do not represent the interests of the party or its leader. “Those people in ODM who sometimes go overboard, na saa zingine wanataka kutusi rais, I will remind them that in our agreement, there was nothing like abusing the government or the President. Hiyo haikuwa. Hiyo ni yao,” he said during President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County. His sentiments were supported by former ODM chairman and current Cabinet Secretary for Treasury John Mbadi. He emphasized that unity pact entered into by the two leaders transcends individual leaders and is focused on national stability, equity, and prosperity for all Kenyans. “If you want to read the body language of Raila Odinga, read Dr. Oburu Odinga. Also check what Junet Mohamed and John Mbadi are saying. Stop listening to other people. We are moving forward. Forward ever, backward never,” he stated. Mbadi reiterated that ODM’s decision clearly indicates that the entire Nyanza region will support Ruto and will no longer participate in activities aimed at undermining the government. “We must help our people to move forward. We will do so under the leadership of only one person – Raila Amolo Odinga – who has chosen to work with President William Samoei Ruto,” he said. “You tell me that we should remain in the streets. Yes, Luos are known for fighting for human rights and we will continue to fight for human rights. But human rights is a wide terminology, it includes political and economic rights. We must also have economic rights,” he added. His energy counterpart Opiyo Wandayi stated that cooperation with President Ruto is a strategic partnership designed to foster national unity and address Kenya’s pressing issues, with no indication of reversing the agreement. “For the naysayers especially in our midst, who still think that we can go backwards, they are daydreaming. We have moved on. We know those who are our genuine friends and we also know those who are not. We have resolved that this region is going to be part and parcel of president William Ruto’s administration,” he stated. Wandayi further stressed that the current agreement between President Ruto and ODM’s Raila Odinga is the best opportunity for the Nyanza region. “If there is anything that has happened to this region (Nyanza) that is worth talking about and is memorable since independence, it is this arrangement of broad-based government by Ruto and Raila. I say so with a lot of confidence and without fear of contradiction,” stated the Energy CS. “We have been in political arrangements and partnerships before, but if there a partnership that is well-meaning and well-guided, it is this broad-based partnership and we have no apologies to make. We have no regrets whatsoever for agreeing as a people and as a party to come and partner with you (President Ruto) and we are not looking back,” he explained. Their sentiments echoed those of Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo. “President William Ruto made a very conscious decision to work with Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. It is not the place of any other leader from this region (Nyanza) to second-guess that decision or to use our youth to perpetuate division and discord,” said Omollo. At the same time, Migori Governor Ochillo Ayacko asserted that county governors should be the last to criticize the National Assembly. “When you see a governor criticizing the national government, that is idiocy. The Constitution is very clear and explicit that the relationship between the national and county governments must be that of mutual respect, cooperation and must work together for the benefit of the people,” he explained. “As governor, I may have my individual feelings or sentiments but because I am head of government, I feel pained if I was to provoke the national government to criticize my own government. Imagine if the President came here to criticize me because of my incessant critique of his administration,” Ayacko added."
Uganda arrests suspect in 2019 kidnapping of US tourist,https://www.kbc.co.ke/uganda-arrests-suspect-in-2019-kidnapping-of-us-tourist/,2025-05-05T12:33:14+03:00,"Derrick Memory,Kampala","Uganda said on Monday it had captured a key suspect in the 2019 armed kidnapping of a US tourist and her driver in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Kimberly Sue Endicott and her Ugandan driver were abducted on April 2, 2019, by armed men who later demanded a ransom of $500,000. They were released four days later following negotiations involving Ugandan and US officials. It was not revealed if the ransom was paid. “The joint security forces finally got the key suspect, Derrick Memory, who has been on the run since 2019,” military spokesman Major Kiconco Tabaro told AFP. Memory had been hiding in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo “where he was involved in other criminal activities”, Tabaro said. Uganda had been tracking the suspect and arrested him in the western district of Kanungu on May 4, he added. “This is a major breakthrough,” Tabaro said, adding that the authorities were determined “to assure tourists and the public that Uganda is safe and those who plan to destabilise our country will be got and firmly dealt with”. Police arrested another suspect, Onesmus Byaruhanga, then 43, during the initial investigation in 2019 for allegedly helping the kidnappers. He currently faces charges of kidnapping and aggravated robbery."
Pakistan conducts second missile test since renewed India standoff,https://www.kbc.co.ke/pakistan-conducts-second-missile-test-since-renewed-india-standoff/,2025-05-05T12:08:26+03:00,"INDIA,Islamabad","The Pakistan military said on Monday it had conducted a missile test with a range of 120 kilometres (75 miles), the second launch in two days as tensions with India have soared over disputed Kashmir. New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for backing a deadly attack on tourists on the Indian side of Kashmir last month, sparking a fresh stand-off between the nuclear-armed neighbours. “The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the military said in a statement. On Saturday, the military said it had tested a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres (280 miles). It did not say where either of the tests took place. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was satisfied with the military’s “full preparedness for national defence”. “The successful training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands,” he said in a statement. The missile training launch comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond to the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied any involvement and called for an independent probe. Islamabad warned last week of an imminent air strike from its neighbour and has repeatedly made clear it will respond with force to any aggression by India. International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad — who have fought several wars over the disputed Kashmir region — to de-escalate. The two sides have exchanged nightly gunfire for more than a week nine along the militarised Line of Control, the de facto border, according to Indian defence sources. Muslim-majority Kashmir, a region of around 15 million people, is divided between Pakistan and India but claimed in full by both. On the Pakistani side, emergency drills have been carried out on playing fields, residents have been told to stock up on food and medicine, and religious schools have been closed. In Indian-run Kashmir, a vast manhunt seeking the gunmen continues across the territory, while those living along the frontier are moving further away — or cleaning out bunkers fearing conflict. Sharif has postponed an official visit to Malaysia scheduled for Friday as tensions mounted, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday. His office said the two sides spoke on Sunday night and that he “conveyed that he looked forward to paying an official visit to Malaysia later this year”. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Islamabad on Monday for an official visit. “Pakistan is presenting its case to friendly countries,” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters on a visit to Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Monday."
Houthis say US bombed Yemen after strike on Israel’s main airport,https://www.kbc.co.ke/houthis-say-us-bombed-yemen-after-strike-on-israels-main-airport/,2025-05-05T12:02:45+03:00,"Houthi,Israel","Yemen’s Houthis on Monday accused the United States of carrying out strikes in and around Sanaa, after the Iran-backed rebels claimed a missile strike on Israel’s main airport. The Houthi-run Saba news agency said the strikes included two on Arbaeen Street in the capital and the airport road, blaming them on “American aggression”. Sixteen people were wounded, Saba cited the Iran-backed rebels’ health ministry as saying. The accusation came after Israel said a missile fired from Yemen struck inside the perimeter of Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday. The Houthis claimed responsibility, saying they fired a “hypersonic ballistic missile” at Ben Gurion, Israel’s main international gateway. The missile gouged a wide crater in the ground near an airport parking lot, wounding six people and forcing airlines to suspend flights. The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen including the capital, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response against the Houthis, as well as its main backer Iran, over the attack. In a video published on Telegram, Netanyahu said Israel had “acted against” the Houthis in the past and “will act in the future”. “It will not happen in one bang, but there will be many bangs,” he added, without elaborating. On social media platform X, Netanyahu said Israel would also respond to Iran at “a time and place of our choosing”. Hours later, the Houthis threatened to launch more such strikes and warned airlines to cancel their flights to Israeli airports. – Iran denial –
Iran on Monday denied supporting the attack, calling it an “independent decision” by the Yemeni rebels taken in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Reacting to Netanyahu’s threats, the Islamic republic warned it would retaliate to any attack against its territory. “Iran underlines (its) firm determination… to defend itself,” the Iranian foreign ministry said, warning Israel and the United States of “consequences”. Following Sunday’s attack, an Israeli police video showed officers standing on the edge of a wide hole in the ground. “You can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres wide and several dozen metres deep,” central Israel’s police chief, Yair Hezroni, said in the recording. “This is the first time” that a missile has directly struck inside the airport perimeter, an Israeli military spokesperson told AFP. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries. An AFP journalist inside the airport during the attack said he heard a “loud bang” at around 9:35 am (0635 GMT), adding that the “reverberation was very strong”. “Security staff immediately asked hundreds of passengers to take shelter, some in bunkers,” the journalist said. – ‘Panic’ –
One passenger said the attack, which came shortly after air raid sirens sounded across parts of Israel, caused “panic”. “It is crazy to say but since October 7 we are used to this,” said the 50-year-old, who did not want to be named, referring to the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war. Flights resumed after being halted briefly, with the aviation authority saying on Sunday that Ben Gurion was “open and operational”. On Sunday, Israel’s army called up tens of thousands of reservists for an expanded Gaza offensive. “This week we are issuing tens of thousands of orders to our reservists to intensify and expand our operation in Gaza,” said army chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir. The army would destroy all Hamas infrastructure, “both on the surface and underground”, he added. Israel’s security cabinet, in a meeting overnight, approved a plan to expand military operations in Gaza, including the “conquest” of the Palestinian territory, an official said Monday. US strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels began under former president Joe Biden, but have intensified under his successor Donald Trump."
"Facing a broken economy, Ghana’s tech-savvy teens turn to fraud",https://www.kbc.co.ke/facing-a-broken-economy-ghanas-tech-savvy-teens-turn-to-fraud/,2025-05-05T11:55:28+03:00,"Cyber Security,Fraud","In the dusty alleys of Nima, a shanty town in the heart of Ghana’s capital, a 17-year-old called Ghost reclines on a faded plastic chair inside a dimly lit internet cafe. Outside, barefoot children chase a punctured football. Inside, Ghost’s fingers dance across the keyboard, his eyes locked on WhatsApp as he engineers a phishing scam that could earn him thousands of cedis in just a few hours. “I made GHC12,000 ($770) last month,” Ghost told AFP, his voice low and calculated, describing an online store he set up on Instagram. “People bought phones and laptops. None of it existed.” Ghost, a pseudonym he gave AFP, is one of a growing number of Accra’s teenagers turning to cybercrime to survive in a country mired in economic crisis, battling both youth unemployment and broken dreams. From mobile money fraud to investment scams, a murky digital underworld is sucking in minors, many working from their bedrooms or small kiosks operating in plain sight — anywhere with a stable internet connection.

– Too good to be true –
Nima’s 441 neighbourhood is a tightly packed, working-class community of corrugated iron housing and open drains. Opportunities are scarce — but mobile phones are not. Ghana’s Cyber Security Authority (CSA) has raised the alarm over a surge in cyberfraud, with financial losses tallying $282,776 between January and March 2025, nearly doubling the $154,241 recorded during the same period in 2024. Officials warn that youth-led scams, powered by social media and peer pressure, are driving the spike. Phishing scams, brand impersonation and fake online shops dominate the scene, with teenagers posing on Snapchat and TikTok as vendors with offers that are too good to be true. Mercy Adumoah, 20, was one such victim. “I saw a page on Snapchat selling heels. I needed a pair for an event, so I paid without thinking twice,” she recounted. After they received the money, the sellers blocked her account. Experts say these crimes have become systemic in a country with a battered economy that is still recovering from a 2023 debt default. Inflation shot above 54 percent in 2022 and has remained above 20 percent into 2025. At a junior high school near Nima, teacher Mohammed Inusah has witnessed a transformation. “Some of my students have iPhones more expensive than my salary,” he told AFP. “They flaunt cash, buy designer clothes and sneakers.” “The parents are either unaware or too afraid to confront them.” – ‘I know it’s wrong’ –
A soft-spoken boy with a mop of dreadlocks who gave the name Tricky said he got his start in scamming by copying scripts from online forums in Nigeria. Later, his cousin taught him mobile money fraud — how to pose as an agent from the local telecom company to get access to people’s accounts. Tricky claims his biggest hit since in his two years of scamming was $500 — twice the monthly salary of a public health nurse or a teacher. “I bought clothes, helped my mum pay rent,” he said. “I know it’s wrong, but tell me, what else can I do?” The CSA has also flagged a dramatic rise in online investment fraud. Between January and August 2024 alone, 149 cases were recorded with losses nearing $128,534. “I fell for one,” admits 18-year-old “Bronzy”, who went from victim to perpetrator. “A guy scammed me using a fake forex trading site. So I learnt the game.” He now runs a group on Telegram promising 20 percent weekly returns. “People invest and I disappear,” he said. Abubakar Issaka, president of the Cyber Security Experts Association of Ghana, said the situation is only getting worse. “The regulations exist… but enforcement is weak. The number of professionals is not growing fast enough to match the fraud cases,” he said. Tracing perpetrators “is a challenge due to poor data integration” between telecoms operators and the national ID database, he added. In some cases, the phone numbers used in frauds “belong to people who died years ago. Fraudsters are steps ahead.” – No end in sight –
Victims suffer anxiety and financial ruin. Scammers are not untouched. Ghost admits he’s often afraid. “Sometimes, I can’t sleep. I wonder if the police will knock. But when I see my friends living large, I feel like I must keep going.” As dusk settles over Nima, Ghost logs off, pockets his burner phone, and steps into the fading light. He didn’t make any money that day. His world is one of quick, fickle wins and quiet fear. But with Ghana’s economy showing no signs of rapid recovery, many more are likely to follow him into the shadows."

A recent report indicates that 1 in every 11 young people, aged between 15 and 24 is using a substance. Consequently, a survey done between November 2024 and February 2025 has put 10 counties at a higher risk for the youth and their indulgence in drugs and substances, which include prescription medication. The counties are Garissa, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisumu, Laikipia, Machakos, Meru, Mombasa, Nakuru and Uasin Gishu. According to public health and professional standards, PS Mary Muthoni, there is a growing number of youth indulging in drugs and substance, a trend that needs to be addressed urgently. The Ministry says it will soon roll out a nationwide campaign to sensitise Kenyans on the harmful effects of drug abuse."
Pathologists to conduct autopsy on slain Kasipul MP today,https://www.kbc.co.ke/pathologists-to-conduct-autopsy-on-slain-kasipul-mp-today/,2025-05-05T07:57:58+03:00,"Kasipul MP Charles Ong'ondo Were,Postmortem","Pathologists, led by Dr. Johansen Oduor, the Government’s Chief Pathologists are set to a conduct a postmortem on the body of slain Kasipul Member of Parliament Charles Ong’ondo Were today (Monday). “An autopsy led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor is scheduled for Monday, May 5, 2025, to provide further insights into the cause of death and support the investigation,” the DCI said Friday through a statement. The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read.
Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
Far-right candidate leads Romania’s presidential rerun,https://www.kbc.co.ke/far-right-candidate-leads-romanias-presidential-rerun/,2025-05-04T22:23:28+03:00,"Calin Georgescu,Crin Antonescu","Romania’s far-right candidate George Simion was leading in Sunday’s first round of presidential elections according to exit polls for the rerun of last year’s annulled ballot that plunged the country into political turmoil. The stakes are high for the NATO country of 19 million, which has become a key pillar of the defence alliance since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Simion, leader of the nationalist AUR party, scored between 30 to 33 percent of the vote, according to two exit polls. Crin Antonescu, backed by Romania’s governing pro-European coalition, was neck-and-neck with Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, who both took between 21 and 23 percent, “Together we made history today,” said Simion in a video message broadcast at his party’s headquarters to supporters chanting “Out with the thieves, let patriots come”. But political science professor Sergiu Miscoiu told AFP that Simion was “likely to be defeated in the second round” on May 18, while predicting that it would be a close race.

– ‘MAGA’ President –
In all, 11 presidential hopefuls were vying for the largely ceremonial but influential foreign policy post on Sunday. The rerun follows the cancellation of last year’s vote won by NATO critic Calin Georgescu. He was barred from the rerun after authorities noted a massive TikTok campaign and issued claims of Russian interference, sparking sometimes violent protests. Georgescu was replaced by 38-year-old Simion, a fan of Donald Trump often seen wearing a cap with the US president’s slogan “Make America Great Again”. “It’s time to take our country back,” said the barred Georgescu after casting his ballot alongside Simion in Mogosoaia, on the outskirts of Bucharest. “We are here with a single mission: to return to democracy — and bring justice to Romania,” said Simion, who campaigned on a promise to put Romania first. Many voters clearly wanted change on Sunday, among them Robert Teodoroiu, who told AFP he hoped that this time his ballot would count after last year’s vote was annulled. “I’m trying my luck again,” said the 37-year-old driver in Bucharest. Voter turnout stood at about 53 percent when polls closed. Simion has largely campaigned online, partly in a bid to woo Romania’s influential overseas voters. While describing himself as “more moderate” than Georgescu, he shares his aversion to what he calls “Brussels’ unelected bureaucrats”. Simion accuses EU officials of having meddled in Romania’s elections and has vowed to restore his country’s “dignity” within the European bloc. While frequently denouncing Russia, he opposes sending military aid to Ukraine and wants Romania to reduce support for Ukrainian refugees. His campaign found favour with 67-year-old Stela Ivan. She hoped a far-right president would bring “change” to Romania after decades dominated by the same political parties since the end of Communism. Another voter, 52-year-old nurse Silvia Tomescu, said she hoped for a “better life, higher wages and a president” who “will not side with Russia”.

– Under scrutiny –
Pro-European coalition Crin Antonescu campaigned on a promise to offer stability, while Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan vowed to fight the “corrupt” and “arrogant” political elite. Former Social Democrats prime minister Victor Ponta, who had been banking on a Trump-style “Romania First” campaign, has been polling behind. Simion promised on Sunday that if he became president, he would get Georgescu into power, citing three options on how he would achieve that: “a referendum, snap elections or the formation of a coalition in parliament that would appoint him Prime Minister”. Following the shock annulment of last year’s ballot — a rare move in the EU — the rerun will be held under close scrutiny. Thousands in Romania have protested in recent months against the annulment of the vote, denouncing what they called a “coup”. The United States also criticised the annulment, with Vice President JD Vance condemning the decision. To avoid a repeat of last year’s turmoil, the authorities have stepped up preventive measures as well as cooperation with TikTok, saying they are committed to “fair and transparent” elections. While the far right alleged “multiple signs of fraud”, the government pointed to various disinformation campaigns it said were “new attempts at manipulation and interference by state actors”."
RSF attack Port Sudan for first time,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rsf-attack-port-sudan-for-first-time/,2025-05-04T22:17:09+03:00,"Army spokesman Nabil Abdallah,Khartoum in March","Sudanese paramilitaries on Sunday struck Port Sudan, the army said, in the first attack on the seat of the army-aligned government during the country’s two-year war. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), battling the regular army since April 2023, have increasingly used drones since losing territory including much of Khartoum in March. Army spokesman Nabil Abdallah said in a statement the RSF “targeted Osman Digna Air Base, a goods warehouse and some civilian facilities in the city of Port Sudan with suicide drones”. He reported no casualties and “limited damage”. Red Sea Military Region Commander Mahjoub Bushra told Sudan’s news agency SUNA the assault lasted three and a half hours and involved 11 drones. AFP images showed smoke above the airport area, about 650 kilometres (400 miles) from the nearest known RSF positions on Khartoum’s outskirts. Later Sunday, an AFP correspondent reported anti-aircraft fire intercepting another drone headed for an air base west of the Red Sea coastal city. In the eastern border town of Kassala near Eritrea, some 500 kilometres south of Port Sudan, witnesses said three drones hit the airport a day after another drone targeted the same site for the first time. Farther south in North Kordofan capital of El-Obeid, residents also reported drones overhead, followed by explosions and plumes of smoke. In February, the army broke a nearly two-year paramilitary siege of El-Obeid, a key link to the vast western Darfur region which is under near-total RSF control. At dawn Sunday, an AFP correspondent in Port Sudan said his home about 20 kilometres from the airport shook as explosions were heard. The airport, a critical hub since the war began, closed temporarily but resumed operations at 5:00 pm (1500 GMT), a Civil Aviation Authority statement said. – Drone warfare –
The paramilitaries led by Mohamed Hamdan Daglo are battling the regular army, headed by Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in a devastating war that has killed tens of thousands and uprooted 13 million. In the conflict’s early days, the government relocated from Khartoum to Port Sudan, which until Sunday had been spared the violence. UN agencies have also moved their operations to Port Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have sought refuge. The conflict has left Africa’s third largest country effectively divided. The army controls the centre, east and north, while the RSF has conquered nearly all of Darfur and parts of the south. Lacking the army’s fighter jets, the RSF has relied on drones for air power. Sudanese analyst Hamid Khalafallah said the RSF has increasingly relied on long-range drones after the “strategic setback of losing Khartoum”. “Without changing their strategy, they risk being confined to Darfur,” he told AFP. Khalafallah said drones help the RSF “create panic and destabilise” northern and eastern cities such as Port Sudan.

– ‘No safe place’ –
Sudan’s government has accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying the paramilitaries with advanced drones. The UAE has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it provided support to the RSF. Satellite imagery analysed by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which tracks the conflict, shows six advanced drones at the RSF-controlled Nyala Airport in Darfur. In an April report, it said the Chinese-made drones “may be capable of long-range surveillance and strikes”. Saudi Arabia, which previously mediated truce talks, Sunday condemned RSF attacks “on vital facilities and infrastructure in Port Sudan and Kassala”. Egypt said the attacks undermine “efforts to restore stability” in the war-torn country. Sunday’s was the latest RSF drone attack on military and civilian infrastructure deep in army-held territory. A retired Sudanese army general told AFP on condition of anonymity such attacks “serve to send a message” that “there is no safe place” for the RSF’s rivals. “Their other objective is to halt air traffic,” he said, and to “impact the armed forces’ supply chain”."
"Iran unveils new ballistic missile with 1,200 km range",https://www.kbc.co.ke/iran-unveils-new-ballistic-missile-with-1200-km-range/,2025-05-04T22:11:08+03:00,"GAZA,Hamas","Iran on Sunday unveiled a new solid-fuel ballistic missile with a range of 1,200 kilometres (745 miles), state television reported, at a time of rising tensions with the West. “The solid propellant Ghassem Basir ballistic missile has a range of at least 1,200 kilometres and is Iran’s latest defence achievement,” the broadcaster said. Western nations have raised concerns about Tehran’s missile capabilities, accusing it of destabilising the Middle East. Iran supports the “axis of resistance” network of militant groups opposed to Israel, including Yemen’s Huthi rebels, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Shiite armed groups in Iraq. In October last year, Iran and its sworn enemy Israel attacked each other directly for the first time. Israel struck military sites in Iran in response to an Iranian missile attack on October 1, itself launched in retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. On Sunday, Iranian state television broadcast footage of the new missile during an interview with Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh. “If we are attacked and war is waged against us, we will respond with force and will target their interests and their bases,” Nasirzadeh said. “We hold no animosity towards neighbouring states, but American bases are our targets,” he said. The new missile was shown after Tehran and Washington held Oman-mediated talks on Iran’s nuclear programme on three consecutive Saturdays from April 12. They were the highest level contacts since the United States withdrew in 2018 from a landmark agreement with world powers on Iran’s nuclear programme. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in an interview with Fox News called on Iran to “walk away” from uranium enrichment, saying “the only countries in the world that enrich uranium are the ones that have nuclear weapons”. On April 27, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a credible deal must “remove Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons” and prevent the development of ballistic missiles. Tehran denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, insisting that its nuclear ambitions are entirely peaceful and for civilian purposes. It has ruled out discussions with Washington on its military and defence capabilities, including its ballistic missile programme. US President Donald Trump has threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails and has imposed additional sanctions targeting the country’s oil sector."

The initiative, funded by the World Bank through the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development (KEMSFED) project, is designed to increase milk production, enhance food security, and stimulate the county’s economy through livestock farming. Each beneficiary received a dairy cow, personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccines and supplements, a starter park, grass seeds and animal feed, as well as sexed semen to support breeding. To date, the Kwale County Government has distributed over 100 dairy cows and more than 200 dairy goats to smallholder farmers across the county. The programme has significantly improved livelihoods and contributed to poverty reduction in rural communities. Speaking during the handover ceremony at Mafisini in Msambweni Constituency, Governor Achani reaffirmed her administration’s commitment to scaling up livestock farming as a pathway to economic empowerment. “I want to state categorically that milk production and value addition in our county will thrive under my administration. Through the continuous distribution of dairy cows and goats, we aim to increase farmers’ income and improve their quality of life,” she said. Ramisi Ward MCA and Kwale County Assembly Majority Leader Hanifa Badi Mwajirani pledged full support from the assembly for community-targeted development projects, including livestock distribution. “We have seen remarkable improvements in milk production thanks to this county initiative. I assure the Governor that any project aimed at benefiting our residents will receive our backing in the assembly,” she said. Priscilla Kyulu, a project beneficiary, praised the county government, noting that the dairy cow she received will help address key livelihood challenges such as food security and school fees. “The success of this project will go a long way in solving the everyday problems we face, especially meeting our basic needs,” she said. As Kwale intensifies its efforts to expand milk production and value addition, Governor Achani has urged residents to take ownership of the dairy project to ensure its sustainability and long-term benefits for farming communities."
Security scare as shoe hurled at President Ruto during Migori tour,https://www.kbc.co.ke/security-scare-as-shoe-hurled-at-president-ruto-during-migori-tour/,2025-05-05T10:12:08+03:00,"Migori County,President William Ruto","A major security scare marred President William Ruto’s tour of Migori County on Sunday evening after an object, believed to be a shoe, was hurled at him during a public event in Kuria West. Security officers swiftly moved in, arresting three individuals suspected to be behind the incident. The President was unharmed, and the event continued without further disruptions. The incident occurred as President Ruto was launching a 200-unit affordable housing project in Kehancha in Kuria West Constituency as part of his ongoing three-day working tour of Migori County that began on May 4. The visit, which runs through May 6, is aimed at commissioning key development projects and inspecting government initiatives across Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Uriri, and Awendo constituencies. Following the scare, security around the Head of State was visibly heightened, with officers tightening control over the remaining itinerary. The tour is part of President Ruto’s broader push to cement support in ODM strongholds after his recent cooperation pact with opposition leader Raila Odinga. It also follows a March 26 meeting with Western Kenya leaders at State House, where Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to regional development, including reviving the ailing sugar sector. Despite the scare, the President is expected to proceed with the launch of key infrastructure projects such as the Stella-Gogo-Sibuoche tarmac road and various healthcare initiatives in the county. Local authorities say investigations into the motive behind the attempted attack are ongoing."

The President said the partnership is helping to confront socio-economic and political challenges that have held Kenya back in the past 60 years, and not about benefitting individual politicians or political parties. Speaking at Kadika Primary School in Suna East, Migori County, during an inter-denominational prayer service on Sunday, President Ruto pointed out that the commitment he and ODM leader Raila Odinga signed to is meant for the common good of all Kenyans. “There is greater benefit in collaboration than competition for individual success,” he said. Additionally, he said national unity holds far greater value than personal political victories. “ODM members should know that this government belongs to them just as it belongs to UDA members and everyone else,” he said. Condoling with the family and the people of Kasipul following the recent murder of MP Charles Were, President Ruto warned that lawlessness and violence cannot be allowed to be part of Kenya’s culture. Saying peace and stability are important ingredients of progress, the President assured Kenyans that the killers of the slain MP and their collaborators will be pursued and the law will take its course. “They will not have anywhere to hide; they will not succeed. We must bring them to book,” he said. Meanwhile, President Ruto called for teamwork and unity among all Kenyans, saying tribalism has no room in the modern day Kenya. The President explained that political rivalry should not hinder development projects meant to uplift communities. “Our focus must be on building roads, improving healthcare, creating jobs, and ensuring that no part of Kenya is left behind,” he said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi criticised those undermining the broad-based government, saying it has greatly helped the region get major development projects like other parts of the country. “If you want to understand Raila Odinga’s body language, listen to what Oburu is saying. If you want to read his body language even more closely, listen to what Junet and I are saying. Forward ever, backward never,” he said. Energy Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi commended the partnership between ODM and UDA that led to the broad-based government, saying it is well guided. “I want to make it clear today that this partnership is well organised. We have no apologies or regrets on what we have done,” the minister said. He accused the naysayers of mischief, adding that they were dreaming if they imagined that there would be a turning back from the broad-based arrangement. “Their true friends are known,” he said. National Assembly Minority Leader Junet Mohammed dismissed the newly formed opposition alliance, mocking it as “directionless and lacking a clear plan for Kenyans”. Mr Mohammed said it was surprising that the coalition’s leaders have yet to point out what they plan to do for the people. Responding to the “Ruto Must Go” slogan popularised by the group, Mr Mohammed remarked that such calls have lost meaning over time. “That slogan doesn’t need launching. You can just shout it into a microphone in Nairobi. We have heard it for years. They said ‘Moi Must Go’ when I was in primary school. We said ‘Uhuru Must Go’ until he completed his term,” he said. The MP further assured President Ruto of ODM’s unwavering support, distancing himself from “the few critical voices” in ODM party. “I want to remind some ODM leaders, who sometimes go overboard, that there is no place for insulting the government or the President. That is their own MOU,” Mr Mohammed said. Siaya Senator Oburu Oginga lashed out at Governor James Orengo over his recent criticism of the broad-based government, daring him to leave the ODM if he was dissatisfied. The senator reminded Mr Orengo that the party’s decision to join the government was a collective resolution, not an individual choice. “When my governor stands up and says he is annoyed, I don’t know with whom. He claims he just wants to speak the truth and I ask myself: What truth?” Mr Oginga Governor Achilo Ayako said residents of Migori County residents are firmly behind the broad-based government for prosperity. After the church service, President Ruto opened the Suna West Sub-County Office in Piny Oyie. He later laid the foundation stone for the Suna West Technical Training College, which will enhance access to technical training in the constituency. And while in Kehancha, Kuria West, President Ruto launched the construction of Affordable Housing Project. Several MPs and MCAs accompanied the President."

He said the prosperity of Kenya is hinged on the unity of purpose that will propel development across the country. He further challenged the region to solidify their support on President William Ruto for he means well for the region. He was speaking when he attended a church service at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Othaya, Nyeri County. “Kuna wakati wa enzi za rais wa tatu Mwai Kibaki, watu walikuwa wakilalamika sana kwamba headlines za gazeti zinabadilika sana.

Focus is very key since the headline that does not change the unity and development of all Kenyans,” said Mudavadi. “Na nyinyi watu wa mlima mkiteleza, mjue sisi tuko tayari tutachukua. Tunawaambia ukweli better  a bird in hand than 10 in the bush. Many regions are saying we wish we had just a fraction of what Mt Kenya region has. So you need to work with the President who has a lot of faith in the people of this region,” he added. Mudavadi noted that communities should not only support the government when one of their own holds the top seat, arguing that such a mindset undermines national unity. “Regions like Western Kenya have never ruled this country but they support the government, so this notion of you have to support the government because one of your own is at the helm, is not the correct philosophy for a united Kenya,” he stated."

The elevation of the facility now places it under the National Government, translating to installation of ultramodern equipment, better staffing, and access to specialised care. National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula lauded the move as a game changer. “Our people will no longer have to travel to Eldoret for treatment. Quality healthcare is coming closer to home,” he said. He also urged Kibabii University to seize the opportunity by developing a comprehensive medical program to support the growing health sector in the region. Bungoma Senator David Wakoli echoed the Speaker’s sentiments terming the elevation “a transformative step that will change the lives of our people.” Speaker Wetang’ula also commended government’s recent decision to scrap unofficial fees and discriminatory practices often levelled on those seeking the crucial document. “Every Kenyan deserves an ID, that is a right, not a favour,” Wetang’ula stated. Moving forward, all Form Four students will receive ID cards before exiting school. Wetang’ula also affirmed that the County Government will restructure factory leadership to protect farmers from exploitation. “We will place power back into the hands of those who till the land,” he said. Senator Wakoli supported the call, noting that “coffee farmers have been defrauded by corrupt cooperatives for too long. We must remove these bad actors and help our people reclaim their livelihoods.”"

South Africa exit from DRC to be completed this month,https://www.kbc.co.ke/south-africa-exit-from-drc-to-be-completed-this-month/,2025-05-04T16:21:27+03:00,"Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,General Rudzani Maphwanya","South African troops withdrawing from the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have begun assembling in Tanzania and most should return home this month, the defence chief said on Sunday. Under the phased withdrawal that started on April 29, the troops are to exit the DRC via Rwanda by road before entering Tanzania, General Rudzani Maphwanya said. From there they will return to South Africa by sea and air by the end of May, he said. The soldiers are part of a regional Southern African Development Community (SADC) force that deployed to the eastern DRC in December 2023 during a resurgence of the M23 armed movement. The M23 now controls swathes of territory in the mineral-rich region. Thirteen trucks with 57 members of the SADC peacekeeping force (SAMIDRC) had already gathered at an assembly point in Tanzania, Maphwanya told reporters. The next group was scheduled for withdrawal next week, he said. “The movement from Tanzania to (South Africa) will be by air for personnel and by sea for cargo,” he said. “Most of the personnel will be nearly complete in South Africa by end of May 2025, except for those who have to oversee the shipping part of the equipment.” SADC decided to end its SAMIDRC mission in mid-March after 17 of its soldiers — most of them South Africans — were killed in M23 offensives in January. They have been stranded there since. The grouping confirmed last week the start of the withdrawal but gave no details. On April 30, a separate evacuation began of hundreds of DRC soldiers and police trapped for months in United Nations bases in Goma after the eastern DRC city was taken by M23 rebels, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. – Leaving nothing behind –
SADC defence chiefs had informed the M23 they would “withdraw… personnel and equipment unconditionally”, Maphwanya said. No SADC equipment would remain. “SADC is not leaving even a pin in eastern DRC,” he added. Officials do not comment on the size of the SAMIDRC deployment but the bulk of the troops come from South Africa, which is estimated to have sent at least 1,300 soldiers. There are also South Africans in the DRC under a separate UN peacekeeping mission. Calls for evacuation began mounting in South Africa after 14 of the country’s soldiers were killed in the region in January. Most were from the SADC mission but at least two were in the UN force. Three Malawian troops in the SADC deployment were also killed, while Tanzania said two of its soldiers died in clashes. The evacuation from the DRC was not a sign of weakness or the abandonment of people caught up in the fighting, Maphwanya said. “Our withdrawal is a technical move that allows peace and mediation to continue.” It came after US President Donald Trump’s senior Africa advisor met Congolese and Rwandan representatives in Qatar last week in what the US said was an effort to end the crisis. UN experts and the United States say the M23 has received military support from Rwanda, an accusation the latter has denied."

Police and the medical examiner’s office “verified there were two passengers in the aircraft, both of whom were fatally injured in the accident,” the county fire department wrote on X. The two homes were occupied at the time of the crash but no injuries to residents were reported, the fire department said.

The Simi Valley Police Department said officers had located the plane “in the backyard of a residence.” Police told CBS News that the pilot, a passenger and a dog were aboard when the plane crashed at around 2:00 pm. The Federal Aviation Administration said, according to CBS, that the plane was a Van’s RV-10, which had taken off from William J. Fox Airfield in Los Angeles County and was heading to Camarillo Airport in neighboring Ventura County. In January, a Van’s RV-10, a small plane with four seats, crashed into a commercial building near Fullerton Municipal Airport southeast of Los Angeles, killing at least two people and injuring 18 others."

"We’ll not take it lying down, ODM leaders demand probe into MP Were’s killing",https://www.kbc.co.ke/well-not-take-it-lying-down-odm-leaders-demand-probe-into-mp-weres-killing/,2025-05-04T14:20:50+03:00,"Gladys Wanga,MP Charles Were","ODM leaders have demanded a thorough and transparent investigation into the killing of Kasipul MP Charles Ong’ondo Were, who was gunned down by unknown assailants on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. The leaders described the incident as a politically motivated assassination and accused state agencies of failing to act on multiple reports the legislator had made about threats to his life. Led by ODM Chairperson and Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, the leaders have threatened to withdraw support from the broad-based government if the killers of the MP are not identified and brought to justice before his burial. “We will not take it lying down, it will not happen. We have counted one too many but this is now a wrong number. Were had his people, Were was killed like a chicken, he was humiliated like a thief and Were never stole from anybody,” said wanga Wanga also claimed there is an active online campaign to mislead the public about the circumstances surrounding Were’s death. “The disinformation that has flooded social media is not by coincidence. It is well orchestrated, it well mobilized, it is well funded, it is well run and the idea is to cover up the murder of Were,” she said. Wanga further disclosed that Were had, on numerous occasions, reported threats to his life, including formal communication to the Inspector General of Police. “Times that we cannot count Were reported that his life was in danger, I know that he even wrote to the Inspector General of Police and I want the IG of Police to tell us, when Were reported all these issues what did he do about it?” she posed. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed termed the incident a politically motivated assassination intended to silence Were. “Sisi kama ODM we are demanding to know what was the motive, who was behind it and what are the reasons why our MP Ong’ondo Were was killed. Tunataka kujua nani amekua nyuma yake, motive ni nini na kwanini amefanya njama ya kuua kiongozi wetu.” So far, police have arrested one suspect linked to the murder and recovered a getaway vehicle used during the incident."

Nyandarua family appeals for help as 17-year-old son battles cancer,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nyandarua-family-appeals-for-help-as-17-year-old-son-battles-cancer/,2025-05-04T10:48:05+03:00,"Appeal for help,cancer","A family in Mugathika village, Rurii Ward, Olkalou Constituency, Nyandarua County, is grappling with emotional and financial strain after their 17-year-old son, Gidraf Mugo Kamande, was diagnosed with stage 2 brain cancer. What started as a small, painless pimple on Mugo’s head gradually enlarged, prompting the family to seek medical attention. After visiting several hospitals, including Olkalou JM County Referral and Nyahururu County Referral, Mugo was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since June last year. His father, Isaac Kamande, says he has sold all his livestock to cover medical costs and is now left with no resources to continue Mugo’s treatment. “We have exhausted everything. We’re now appealing to well-wishers and leaders in Nyandarua County to help us raise funds so that Mugo can resume treatment, possibly even seek specialised care in another hospital,” he said. Mugo’s mother, Jane Kamande, expressed deep concern over her son’s worsening condition. “Since his last hospital visit, more tumours have developed on his head, and they are growing larger by the day,” she revealed. Mugo has undergone several surgeries, including the removal of his adrenal artery, which has resulted in the spread of fluid-like masses on his head. The disease has severely disrupted Mugo’s education at Mukindu Day Secondary School, where he was set to sit for national exams this year. His dream of becoming a doctor is now in jeopardy. “He can barely sleep due to the pain. I have to stay up most nights taking care of him,” Jane added. The family is calling on Kenyans of goodwill to support Mugo’s medical journey. Donations can be sent to: Bank: Family Bank

Singapore ruling party wins election in landslide,https://www.kbc.co.ke/singapore-ruling-party-wins-election-in-landslide/,2025-05-04T09:04:08+03:00,"Prime Minister Lawrence Wong,Singapore","Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) has won a landslide victory in the country’s general election, giving Prime Minister Lawrence Wong a strong mandate to lead. The party won 87 out of 97 seats in Parliament, with 65.57 percent of the more than 2.4 million votes cast. This gives Wong solid support to guide the country through tough times, especially with worries about new trade tariffs from the United States. “Singaporeans gave the PAP a strong mandate to govern,” Wong told a news conference hours after the official results were announced. “The results will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world,” he said, adding they were a “clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government”. This was Wong’s first major election since becoming prime minister last year, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong. Wong warned that new US tariffs could hurt Singapore’s economy and asked voters to support him so he could keep the country open and competitive. Even though more young voters are listening to the opposition, and PAP has faced some scandals, the party still increased its support compared to the 2020 election. The Workers’ Party (WP), the largest opposition group, hoped to gain more seats but only kept its previous 10. The party had attracted large crowds during the campaign, but it didn’t turn into more votes. PAP has ruled Singapore since its independence and is known for keeping the country stable and wealthy. However, it has also been criticised for limiting free speech and political competition. Wong’s strong leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic helped boost his popularity. With this big win, he now has the power to make important changes to protect Singapore’s economy from global problems."
"Australian PM basks in win, vows ‘orderly’ government",https://www.kbc.co.ke/australian-pm-basks-in-win-vows-orderly-government/,2025-05-04T08:49:38+03:00,"Australia,Prime Minister Anthony Albanese","Australia’s left-leaning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese basked Sunday in his landslide election win, promising a “disciplined, orderly” government to confront cost-of-living pain and tariff turmoil. Residents clapped as the 62-year-old and his fiancee Jodie Haydon visited his old inner Sydney haunt, Cafe Italia, surrounded by a crowd of jostling photographers and TV journalists. Albanese’s Labor Party is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed. Opposition leader Peter Dutton’s conservative Liberal-National coalition had just 36 seats, and other parties 12. Another 20 seats were still in doubt. “We will be a disciplined, orderly government in our second term,” Albanese said, after scooping ice cream for journalists in a cafe he used to visit with his mum. “She would be very proud,” Albanese said of his late, single mother Maryanne, who raised him in a modest government-subsidised Sydney flat. “We’ve been given a great honour of serving the Australian people, and we don’t take it for granted, and we’ll work hard each and every day,” he said. Dutton, a hard-nosed former policeman — who critics tagged “Trump-lite” for policies that included slashing the civil service — endured the rare humiliation of losing his own seat. US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory — but analysts said they helped. “If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that’s the biggest thing,” said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney. “In times of instability, we expect people to go back to a kind of steady incumbent.” The scale of Albanese’s win took his own party by surprise. “It’s still sinking in,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers said. “This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,” Chalmers told national broadcaster ABC. But the win came with “healthy helpings of humility”, he said, because under-pressure Australians want “stability in uncertain times”. Albanese has promised to embrace renewable energy, cut taxes, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system. Dutton wanted to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power. Before the first vote was even counted, speculation was mounting over whether the 54-year-old opposition leader could survive an election loss. “We didn’t do well enough during this campaign. That much is obvious tonight and I accept full responsibility,” Dutton told supporters in a concession speech. Economic concerns have dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol. “The cost of living — it’s extremely high at the moment… Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,” human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane. The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were moments of unscripted levity. Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football. Leaders around the world congratulated Albanese on his triumph. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he hoped to “promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific” with Australia,  a “valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States”. An unnamed Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing was “ready to work” with Australia’s government. Albanese said he had spoken with the prime ministers of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, and received “some good text messages” from leaders in Britain, France, “and a range of others”. The premier said he planned to speak with the leaders of Indonesia and Ukraine, promising to back Kyiv against Russia’s invasion: “That’s my government’s position. It was yesterday. It still is.”"
Changan unveils full brand lineup and NEV innovations at Auto Shanghai 2025,https://www.kbc.co.ke/changan-unveils-full-brand-lineup-and-nev-innovations-at-auto-shanghai-2025/,2025-05-04T19:48:26+03:00,,"Auto Shanghai 2025 opened on April 23, with Changan Automobile drawing considerable attention by unveiling its full range of brands and latest new energy vehicles (NEVs) innovations to over 600 media outlets and 500 global partners. During the event, CHANGAN unveiled its latest achievements and future strategy through three major initiatives: the “Shangri-La Plan” for new energy, the “Dubhe Plan” for intelligent tech, and the “Vast Ocean Plan” for global expansion. Its three core brands—CHANGAN, AVATR, and DEEPAL—showcased their latest products. Among the highlights at CHANGAN’s booth was the Q07, a mid-size SUV that made its debut equipped with the advanced Deepseek model. The Q07 impresses with its expansive space, extended driving range, and next-generation smart features. AVATR, CHANGAN’s high-end smart new energy vehicle brand, presented the newly launched AVATR 06, along with other models, including the AVATR07, 11, and 12. These models are powered by advanced smart driving technology and feature distinctive designs. Meanwhile, DEEPAL, targeting younger, tech-savvy consumers, unveiled its first full-size SUV, the DEEPAL S09. This model combines style, safety, and an exhilarating driving experience, all while showcasing the brand’s commitment to delivering value to its target market. Zhu Huarong, Chairman of Changan Automobile, took the stage to share the company’s ambitious global strategy. “CHANGAN will introduce 45 new products globally over the next five years, with a sales target of 5 million vehicles by 2030,” he announced. In 2024, CHANGAN achieved an overseas sales volume of 536,000 vehicles, marking an impressive 47.9% year-on-year growth and securing a spot among the top three Chinese automobile exporters. Songvit Titipoonya, CEO of Eternity at One, AVATR, and DEEPAL’s distributor in Thailand, shared that the first 500 AVATR buyers were former loyalists of top Japanese and European brands. Their positive experience with the premium EV has sparked strong word-of-mouth, aligning perfectly with AVATR’s high-end positioning in the Thai market. Lee Barret, an independent content creator from the UK, recently visited CHANGAN’s Nanjing factory and attended its release conference. Sharing his views on Chinese EVs, he remarked,  “I think European cars lag somewhat behind Chinese EV brands. Chinese brands over the last few years have rocketed in not just quality but their technology, and I think they are some of the best cars in the world now.” As part of its high-quality growth strategy, CHANGAN has embedded sustainability into its core operations. Its debut on the “China ESG Listed Companies Pioneer 100” list highlights the company’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Looking ahead, CHANGAN plans to invest over 200 billion yuan (approx. USD 27.43 billion) in the next decade to build a next-gen automotive tech ecosystem. The plan includes expanding its R&D team by 10,000, developing smart automotive robots, testing flying cars by the end of the year, and launching humanoid robots by 2028."

He referred to an incident reported by the international non-governmental organization Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which said its Gaza aid ship “Conscience” was bombed by drones in international waters off the coast of Malta early on Friday, blaming the strike on Israel. In a statement released by his ministry, Baghaei said the attack on the ship was carried out in line with Israel’s plan against the Palestinians and to ensure the continuation of the Gaza aid blockade, calling it “a clear crime against Palestinians and a terrorist action against maritime security and safety.” He stressed that depriving Gaza residents, particularly children, women, and the wounded, of food, water, and medicines was considered “a clear instance of war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Baghaei also described the United States and other supporters of Israel as accomplices in “these crimes,” voicing Iran’s solidarity with the “oppressed” Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. On Friday, Malta’s government confirmed that maritime authorities had received a distress call from a vessel outside the country’s territorial waters and offered immediate assistance. Local media said the vessel’s crew members were rescued, with no injuries reported. The media reports noted that an Israeli military aircraft hovered around Malta hours before the vessel was attacked. Israel has not officially commented on the incident or related reports so far."

"Tanzania, Malawi end trade standoff after diplomatic talks",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tanzania-malawi-end-trade-standoff-after-diplomatic-talks/,2025-05-03T21:53:55+03:00,"Malawi,Tanzania","Tanzania and Malawi ended their trade standoff after bilateral discussions that reaffirmed a shared commitment to strengthening trade, fostering economic cooperation, and resolving existing issues. A jointly-signed communique issued on Friday after a bilateral meeting between senior officials of the two countries said they agreed to lift trade restrictions, pledging to finalize legal frameworks required for the signing of the Simplified Trade Regime Agreement (STRA). Both delegations reaffirmed their commitment to finalizing the relevant legal framework for the STRA and to implementing it upon completion of domestic legal processes by May 30, said the communique signed by Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Mahmoud Thabit Kombo and Malawian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nancy Gladys Tembo. According to the communique, Malawi appreciated Tanzania’s decision to lift the import ban on plant and plant products from Malawi, which Tanzania imposed on April 23. In reciprocity, the government of Malawi committed to issuing an administrative instrument to the relevant authorities to facilitate imports and exports between the two countries, with effect from the date of this communique, said the communique. Tensions began in March after Malawi imposed restrictions on selected agricultural produce from Tanzania, escalating in April when Tanzania implemented reciprocal measures. Tanzania also imposed similar restrictions on South Africa, which had blocked agricultural imports from Tanzania.
However, in a public notice issued on April 25, Tanzanian Minister of Agriculture Hussein Bashe confirmed that the restrictions had been suspended, effective April 23. The ban was officially lifted on April 26 following diplomatic overtures from Malawi and South Africa, aimed at fostering dialogue and strengthening cooperation."
Yemen Prime Minister Mubarak resigns,https://www.kbc.co.ke/yemen-prime-minister-mubarak-resigns/,2025-05-03T21:40:03+03:00,"Ahmed Bin Mubarak,Houthi Rebels","The premier of Yemen’s internationally recognised government, former diplomat and foreign minister Ahmed Bin Mubarak, announced his resignation on Saturday saying he was unable to fully exercise his powers. Bitter disputes had for months opposed Bin Mubarak and Rashad al-Alimi, who heads the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), two ministers and a member of the PLC told AFP. They requested anonymity in order to speak freely. After Iran-backed Huthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, Yemen’s government withdrew to Aden in the south. The rebels went on to control most population centres in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of beleaguered government forces in 2015, but with little success. On Saturday, Bin Mubarak posted on X that he had met the PLC’s Alimi and resigned. He also shared his resignation letter in which he said: “I could not exercise my constitutional powers and take the necessary decisions to reform government institutions or implement rightful governmental changes.” His move comes as the Huthis wage a campaign of missile attacks on Israel and target shipping in key waterways in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza. Bin Mubarak said that despite the obstacles he had managed to achieve “many successes in a short space of time”, citing fiscal and administrative reforms and an anti-corruption drive. However, analyst Mohammed Albasha, of the US-based Basha Report Risk Advisory, told AFP Bin Mubarak had been “in constant friction with the Presidential Leadership Council”. “Bin Mubarak wanted to be more than Prime Minister — he wanted the powers of the presidency. That aspiration isolated him politically,” Albasha said. – ‘Power struggle’ –
The Yemeni official sources who spoke to AFP said Bin Mubarak had suspended the budgets of several ministries including defence, citing corruption, further fuelling tensions. “His drive for greater power — viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition — led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most Council members,” Albasha said. “Over time, this power struggle eroded trust.” Bin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the United States, is a staunch adversary of the Huthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him for several days. Previously he was chief of staff of the presidential office and Yemen’s envoy to the United Nations. He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on February 5, 2024. His departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen’s internationally recognised government — a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion,” Albasha said. The war in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting decreased significantly after a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022. Since the war in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Huthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it. The Huthis paused their attacks during a two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March a threat to resume attacks over Israel’s Gaza aid blockade triggered a renewed and sustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yemen they control."
Politicians funding and fanning cattle rustling on the spot,https://www.kbc.co.ke/politicians-funding-and-fanning-cattle-rustling-on-the-spot/,2025-05-04T01:19:50+03:00,"Banditry,Cattle rustling","A newly released report by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration has laid bare the deadly and growing nexus between politics, the commercialisation of banditry and a crisis that continues to devastate pastoralist communities in Kenya. The report paints a grim picture of how political incitement and black-market livestock economics have sustained a cycle of violence, characterised by maiming, death, displacement and economic disenfranchisement of pastoral communities whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen interacts with wananchi on the sidelines of a security meeting at Kampi Samaki,Baringo County on May 2 2025. “Let us shun all acts of political incitement and revenge,” Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said as he released the report detailing the countrywide status of efforts to combat cattle rustling. “I urge political leaders to stop playing politics with such important national security concerns,” he added. Covering the first quarter of 2025, the report notes a sharp decline in livestock theft, from 263 incidents in the same period last year to 167 this year. The number of stolen livestock dropped from 8,557 to 4,935. While the data points to progress, the criminals continue to unleash terror. “These gains are the result of the concerted efforts of our security officers, including the National Police Reservists, who have worked tirelessly in close collaboration with local communities,” Murkomen stated. Murkomen, who was captured on camera engaging residents in Marigat, Baringo County, is seen in widely circulated footage interacting with locals, among them an elderly man representing the community. Referring to the security meeting held at Kampi ya Samaki with officers from the National Police Service, National Government Administration Officers, and National Police Reservists, the old man said, “Thank you for coming here today… We have persevered. We have a big problem, and we do not want it to spread. Our agenda number one is peace, number two is peace,  agenda number three is peace.” Despite the series of consultative security meetings, the attacks continued. Bandits struck again in Chemoi, Baringo North, killing two people and seriously injuring eight others, including a National Police Reservist. This came just a week after a similar attack on the Marigat to Tangulbei road, where a woman was killed and three others were injured. Referencing the quarterly report, the Cabinet Secretary noted, “Unfortunately, as a result of these criminal acts, 21 persons, one police officer, eight civilians and twelve suspects, were killed in the first quarter of the year 2025 compared to 58 persons who unfortunately died in the same period in 2024.” The report underscores that banditry remains a deeply entrenched national security threat. The Cabinet Secretary identified three main acts that continue to fuel the criminal activity: “political interference and incitement, the commercialisation of banditry through accessible markets for stolen livestock, and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.” He also cited other contributing factors, including resource-based conflicts over water and pasture, land boundary disputes, and remote criminal hideouts worsened by poor infrastructure. “The government is working hard to set aside resources for infrastructure development, including schools, and to provide our security officers with better equipment and resources to tackle these challenges,” he said. As Kenya moves into the next quarter of 2025, Murkomen affirmed the government’s resolve to maintain momentum in the war against banditry. But the call was clear: those funding or fanning the flames of violence under the guise of politics must stop."

The Cabinet Secretary who spoke at the Global Media Dialogue held during the inaugural  World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai, India highlighted the transformative potential of media and entertainment in driving development, cross-cultural understanding and innovation. “With 44 distinct communities and a rich storytelling tradition—from Nairobi’s vibrant film scene to the soulful rhythms of benga music—Kenya is amplifying African voices. We invite global partners to invest in African content that connects, uplifts and inspires”, he declared. Kabogo showcased Kenya’s pioneering policies, including tax incentives, expanded connectivity and platforms like M-Pesa, which empower creators through digital monetisation. He stressed the need for global cooperation to protect intellectual property, bridge the digital divide, and uphold creators’ rights across the Global South. In a world where misinformation threatens stability, Kabogo stressed the urgency of joint efforts to safeguard truth. “Kenya advocates for ethical standards, AI verification tools and harmonised content policies to combat misinformation, especially during elections and crises”, he noted. Cultural exchange, he argued, remains a vital bridge between nations, adding that through Diaspora networks, regional partnerships and co-productions, Kenya is fostering mutual respect and global unity. “At the heart of this vision is the youth, who are mastering digital skills and building Africa’s next generation of media platforms. I  urge the world to partner with Kenya’s thriving tech ecosystem to harness this potential”, said the Cabinet Secretary. Proposing a global repository of best practices, Kabogo envisioned a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering ethical, inclusive and sustainable innovation. “Let us commit to a media landscape that is diverse, ethical, and forward-looking. Kenya stands ready to lead, to partner and to co-create a new chapter for global media.” The Global Media Dialogue convened government leaders to explore media’s role in development, innovation, and peace-building, with a focus on emerging technologies, inclusivity and international collaboration."

Speaking during an empowerment and fundraising drive held at Friends Secondary School, Shamakhokho in Vihiga County, the legislators stood in unity to defend the two funds and urged citizens to come out in numbers for the Countrywide Public Participation set to begin this coming Monday as Parliament moves to entrench the funds in the Constitution. Speaker of the National Assembly, Moses Wetang’ula, called for a shift from divisive politics to people-driven development. “We must reduce politics and deepen development conversations. If leaders lack a strong connection with the people, their political journeys will be short-lived. Let our relationship with our people be built on service,” he stated. Luanda MP Dick Maungu addressed misconceptions surrounding NG-CDF, saying the fund is meant to benefit Kenyans at the grassroots level. “This is not money for Members of Parliament, it belongs to the people and its managed by a board not the Member of Parliament. Every shilling is meant to improve lives at the grassroots,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi, who encouraged residents to make their voices heard during the public hearings. “Come out on Monday and share your views on the future of NG-CDF during the public participation.” Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana emphasized the importance of both NG-CDF and NGAAF in changing lives and transforming communities. “The fund is building schools, creating opportunities, and giving our children a future. I urge everyone to show up during public participation, let the government hear you.” said Aldai MP Marianne Kaitany. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi, defended the structure and integrity of the fund, clarifying that, “CDF is managed by a board and not MPs. If this fund didn’t exist, many schools would still be in deplorable conditions. While we must root out corruption, we cannot dismantle tools that are working for Kenyans. This is a democratic country, let the people decide.” Kakamega County MP Elsie Muhanda noted that NGAAF has brought real change, particularly for women and youth. Kiminini lawmaker Kakai Bissau concluded urged transparency and care in managing the funds. “These are the quickest funds that reach the people.

Speaking during a fundraising and empowerment event in Vihiga County hosted by Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala, Mudavadi urged leaders from the region to close ranks and focus on a shared political direction. “The Western region must unite and speak with one voice. We are stronger when we walk together,” Mudavadi stated. The event brought together key leaders from the Western region, including National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula and Sirisia MP John Walukhe, as the region strategises its political direction ahead of the 2027 general election. Wetang’ula echoed the calls for unity, stating that the that region stands to benefit more by speaking with one voice on matters of national development. “We have been in politics for some time and we know that in politics, however wise you are, without the people you amount to nothing. As a region, we must walk together and speak the same language in development matters as we rally behind President William Ruto,” Wetang’ula stated. On his part, MP Walukhe defended the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), warning against any attempts to abolish it. He argued that the fund continues to support development projects at the grassroots level especially in education and infrastructure."

The hearings, part of the public participation process on the proposed Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill No. 4 of 2025, will take place across all 290 constituencies and 47 counties from May 5 to May 7. The bill seeks to entrench NG-CDF, the Senate Oversight Fund, and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) into the Constitution. According to a notice by Parliament, the forums will be conducted between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm in each of the constituencies and at the offices of all 47 County Women Representatives. “The National Assembly is inviting YOU to take part in a Public Partcipation Exercise on the proposed Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill No. 4 of 2025 which seeks to enshrine the National Government Constituencies Fund (NG-CDF), the Senate Oversight Fund, and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF)  into the Constitution of Kenya,” the notice reads. The exercise is expected to gather public views on the continued existence of the funds, which have previously faced legal challenges over constitutional validity. Members of the public who wish to submit written memoranda expressing their views on the bill have been urged to do so by sending an email to cna@parliament.go.ke or constitutionamendment@parliament.go.ke.

Speaking during the disbursement of bursary cheques worth Ksh41.5 million under the NG-CDF, local leaders and residents underscored the critical role the funds play in supporting needy students. The event comes ahead of public participation forums on the NG-CDF Amendment Bill 2025, which the National Assembly has scheduled for next week. Malindi MP Amina Mnyazi cautioned that abolishing the NG-CDF would cut off a vital support system for many families. “If CDF is abolished today, where do you expect all these parents to get help from? Even if they are getting small amounts, it is better than nothing at all,” she stated. Chairman of the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association in Kilifi County, Emmanuel Kitsao, stressed the impact bursaries have on bright students from low-income families. “There are many students from poor families who cannot continue with their studies. Most bright students come from poor families. When they get help, they can change the economic situations of their families,” he said. Malindi residents Stephen Opiyo and Agnes Annah echoed his sentiments calling for more financial resources to the kitties instead of abolishing them altogether."

Deputy Director in the Department of Veterinary Services Michael Kyalo echoed the remarks, urging locals to embrace the project and benefit from the training and services it will offer. Kanyonyoo MCA Mark Nding’o welcomed the initiative, noting it would have significant socio-economic benefits for the local community."
"Tourism sector records growth as regulator licenses over 33,000 enterprises",https://www.kbc.co.ke/tourism-sector-records-growth-as-regulator-licenses-over-33-000-enterprises/,2025-05-03T12:39:06+03:00,"Tourism,TRA","Over 33,000 tourism enterprises across the country have been registered and licensed by the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) after meeting the set standards. According to TRA, the number of enterprises offering tourism services is expected to rise further in the coming year. This emerged during the Heads of Housekeeping Association of Kenya (HHPA) annual meeting in Lake Naivasha Resort and that attracted participants from different counties. According to Frederick Omondi, the Director Standards and Quality Assurance, the authority had developed eighteen standards in a bid to address quality services in the sector. This, according to him, formed the basis of regulating the enterprises to ensure that the sector was regulated in a sustainable manner. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the meeting, Omondi noted that the tourism sector was on the right track despite emerging challenges and competition from neighboring countries. “We have seen a growing number of new entrants in terms of new restaurants, new hotels, new tour operators, new tour guides and even Airbnbs,” he said. He added that the authority had conducted a country-wide national accreditation exercise that had seen a number of hospitality facilities awarded gold on the basis of the quality performance. “After the accreditation, we had a total of 303 gold awardees, 342 silver awardees and 346 bronze awardees and we are now prepared for the East Africa classification system,” he said. On challenges, he admitted that there was a huge disconnect between the hotel managers and investors which the authority was prepared to address. The Chairman HHPA Antipas Nyambok said that most housekeepers were not recognized by their employers who tended to think housekeeping was in the back of the hotel business. Nyabok added that room business, depending on the setup of the hotel, contributed between 60 to 80 percent of the total hotel revenue. “The housekeepers must be trained, supervised and they should be brought up to speed each and every moment as they are critical to hotel operations,” he said. A medical practitioner Dr. Darius Wambua said that awareness among workers in the hospitality industry had seen cases of Occupational Health and Safety cases come down. “Psychosocial stresses among workers end up causing psychosomatic disorders and this impacts eventually on productivity and hence the need to create awareness,” he said. Others who spoke were Samuel Mungai from NEMKEM Company which offers hygiene solutions for the hospitality industry, processed foods, healthcare and cleaning contracts. “Business in the hospitality sector has improved since Covid-19 as Kenyans have accepted to travel and the hospitality industry is gaining more traction and more occupancy,” he said."

Speaking during a funeral at Gwassi South Location in Suba South, Homa Bay County, Mbadi urged investigative agencies to move swiftly and apprehend those responsible. The MP was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Wednesday evening near the City Mortuary roundabout in Nairobi. “I’m saddened by what happened to my friend and someone we have worked with in Parliament for seven years. I spoke with the President. He is very annoyed and has given stern instructions that the culprits must be brought to book,” Mbadi said. Mbadi singled out Kasipul and Ndhiwa Constituencies as emerging hotspots for political violence in the county. “There is violence taking root in Homa Bay and we must condemn it. It is not worth it. Don’t take the lives of our people because of a political seat. In Ndhiwa Constituency, people are attacking each other with pangas in the name of politicians,” he said. The CS called out politicians allegedly behind the chaos, saying they must be held accountable and expelled from political parties. “To those politicians promoting violence in Homa Bay County, you must stop. You cannot force people to vote you into power or back to power. Please respect people’s choices, be democratic and persuade people to vote for you,” urged Mbadi. “We will announce publicly that such politicians should not be associated with parties we support.

Speaking during an inspection tour of the Ganze dam water project at Ganze Village in Matuga Constituency, Achani emphasized the importance of collaboration between the residents and the County government in the fight against climate change and the solution for water shortages. “In order to do away with the water challenges facing some parts of the County, we must plant more trees. I therefore expect everyone of us to take the responsibility of restoring our land.” Said Achani. The Governor also led the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings, including, Casuarina, arborea and mango trees. Achani noted that the completion of the Ganze dam excavation project which included installation of solar panels, livestock water points, water kiosks, and distribution of the seedlings, are part of her government’s efforts to ensure that drought becomes a thing of the past in the county. “My administration is committed to ensure that the issue of drought is dealt with effectively.” She said. Over the past years, Kwale’s arid areas of Kinango, Samburu and LungaLunga majorly relied on relief food for survival due to the harsh dry conditions which affected the agricultural sector in the regions. In an effort to overcome the situation, the County constructed over 20 water dams, which provides enough water for irrigation, livestock and for domestic uses. Nyalani Dam in Kinango Ward, Nuru Dam (Puma), Mtaa dam (Mwavumbo), Mwakalanga (Mwereni), Chikwakwani ( Kasemeni) and Bang’a Dam in Kinango Sub-County are examples of water dams supporting agriculture in the region."

The President pointed out that the policies his administration has undertaken have led to the improvement of the economy. “I can proudly say the people of Kenya, through the decisions we have made collectively, are reaping the fruits because the economy is now stable, ” he pointed out. He urged the elders to ensure that parents take children to school without discrimination over gender. “Education is critical and the Maa community should not be left behind. You should take all children to school, boys and girls, without discrimination,” President Ruto said. He also asked leaders to discourage divisive politics and embrace unity for the sake of peace and cohesion. “As Kenyans, we should unite and discourage politics based on tribalism if we have to address challenges facing our people collectively, ” said President Ruto. Governor Lenku assured the President of support of the Maa community in implementing the government’s agenda. On his part, Senator Ledama ole Kina said the Maa community would rally behind the leadership of President Ruto for the prosperity of the country. “I have come here specifically to assure President Ruto of my total support in implementing his agenda for this country,” he said."

The general and former junta leader, who toppled Ali Bongo in August 2023 ending 55 years of dynastic rule by the Bongo family, officially takes the presidential reins after leading a 19-month transition government. Several African heads of state are expected to attend the inauguration in a 40,000-capacity stadium, north of the capital Libreville. They include Gambia’s Adama Barrow, Senegal’s Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Djibouti’s Ismail Omar Guelleh and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo from Equatorial Guinea. According to local and international media, Democratic Republic of Congo’s president Felix Tshisekedi will also be present, along with his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame, whose attendance was confirmed by Kigali’s foreign ministry. Kigali and Kinshasa are currently in talks to end fighting in eastern DRC. Tickets were free to attend the investiture at the Angondje stadium, built to honour friendship between Gabon and China, and it will be the first time the country holds a swearing-in ceremony in front of such a large audience. – Challenges ahead –
The event is slated to have artistic performances and a military parade, according to state media, which will be followed by a “victory concert” on the Libreville waterfront in the evening. In the lead-up, hundreds of workers have been painstakingly cleaning and repainting areas around the main roads leading to the stadium. Authorities and official media have called for people to be public-spirited in view of the influx of foreign guests. “All citizens of Greater Libreville are asked to extend a warm welcome to these distinguished guests,” the interior ministry said in a statement. It called on residents near the stadium to “take part in cleaning and beautifying” the area. Oligui, 50, faces serious challenges in leading the oil-rich country, which needs to revamp crucial infrastructure and diversify its economy but is heavily indebted. Among the main concerns are an ageing electricity network which suffers frequent power cuts, youth unemployment that hovers at 40 percent, poor or lacking roads and a ballooning public debt, forecast to hit 80 percent of GDP this year. During the transition, Oligui portrayed himself as a “builder”, launching numerous construction projects, while vowing to “crack down” on corruption to get the country back on track."
UN judge jailed for keeping housekeeper as slave,https://www.kbc.co.ke/un-judge-jailed-for-keeping-housekeeper-as-slave/,2025-05-03T08:22:07+03:00,"Lydia Mugambe,Oxford","A United Nations judge has been jailed for six years and four months for forcing a woman to work as a domestic slave. Lydia Mugambe, 50, was studying for a PhD in law at the University of Oxford when police discovered she had a young Ugandan woman at her home carrying out unpaid work as a maid and nanny. Mugambe, who is also a High Court judge in Uganda, was jailed at Oxford Crown Court on Friday after she was found guilty of modern day slavery offences in March. In sentencing, Judge David Foxton told the defendant she “showed absolutely no remorse” for her actions and she had looked to “forcibly blame” the victim for what happened. Mugambe fraudulently arranged a visa for the woman but it stipulated she would be paid to work as a private servant at the diplomatic residence of John Mugerwa, Uganda’s former deputy high commissioner based at the country’s embassy in London. Prosecutors said Mr Mugerwa sponsored the victim’s visa knowing she would actually work in servitude for Mugambe. In return, Mugambe would provide him assistance in relation to a separate court case in Uganda in which he was a defendant, the court was told. The trial heard Mugambe paid for the victim’s flight and picked her up from the airport – but the young woman then became a slave at the judge’s home in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Mr Foxton described it as a “very sad case” as he outlined Mugambe’s legal accomplishments, including her work in the protection of human rights. In a written statement, read to the court by prosecutor Caroline Haughey KC, the victim described living in “almost constant fear” due to Mugambe’s powerful standing in Uganda. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she “can’t go back to Uganda” due to fear of what may happen to her and added that she may never see her mother again. Ms Haughey said Mugambe exploited her victim by taking advantage of her lack of knowledge about employment rights and misleading her about why she came to the UK. She said there was a “clear and significant imbalance of power within the relationship” between Mugambe and her victim. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised police to charge Mr Mugerwa with conspiracy but he had diplomatic immunity, which the Ugandan Government did not waive. Mugambe had denied forcing the young Ugandan woman to do household chores and said she “always” treated her with love, care and patience. Ch Supt Ben Clark, of Thames Valley Police, said there was “no doubt” that Mugambe had known she was committing offences. “Modern slavery is an under reported crime and I hope that the bravery of the victim in this case encourages other victims of modern slavery to come forward,” he said. A University of Oxford spokesperson said the institution was “appalled” by its student’s crimes. “The university is now commencing its own disciplinary process, which has the power to remove students convicted of serious criminal offences,” the spokesperson added."

Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the tragic stampede” at Lairai Devi temple in the village of Shirgao in the early hours of Saturday morning. “Six people died even before they could be brought to the hospital,” Sawant told reporters. He visited the hospital and said that “all possible support” would be given to the families of those killed or injured. Vishwajit Rane, Goa state health minister said “approximately 80” people were injured. “Five are critical and on ventilator support, while the remaining are being treated in the specially created emergency ward,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office expressed “condolences to those who lost their loved ones”. The Lairai Zatra is a key Hindu celebration in Goa and is marked by a fire-walking ceremony. Deadly stampedes are notoriously common in Indian religious festivals. Earlier this year, at least 30 people were killed in an early morning crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu mega-festival in the northern city of Prayagraj."

In Kenya, nearly 30% of households are food insecure—particularly in arid and semi-arid regions—while malnutrition among children persists at alarming levels. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 18% of children under five are stunted, 10% are underweight, 5% suffer from wasting, and 3% are overweight—painting a grim picture of the nation’s nutritional well-being. In response to this crisis, First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, through her flagship Mama Kitchen Garden initiative—supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development—is championing efforts to enhance food security and improve nutrition at the household and school level. The initiative promotes nutrition-sensitive agriculture, agritech innovation, climate-smart farming, and women’s economic empowerment. It encourages families and learning institutions to embrace kitchen gardens as a sustainable way to access fresh, nutritious food while fostering agricultural education. Speaking during the National Mama Kitchen Garden Private Sector and Development Partners Breakfast Meeting held at the Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) Headquarters, Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Kipronoh Ronoh emphasized the need for a coordinated and inclusive approach to ensure long-term impact. He highlighted the value of school kitchen gardens as “outdoor laboratories,” offering students hands-on learning in soil testing, plant growth, pest control, and sustainable farming. “Experiential learning fosters curiosity, innovation, and paves the way for the next generation of agricultural scientists and environmental stewards,” said Dr. Ronoh. He also noted the initiative’s potential to create mentorship opportunities by connecting students with seasoned farmers and agricultural experts in structured, knowledge-sharing platforms. For urban families and schools with limited space, Dr. Ronoh encouraged the adoption of vertical farming and hydroponics as innovative solutions to boost food production in constrained environments. Elizabeth Koskei, CEO of Mama Doing Good, the organization implementing the initiative jointly with the State Department for Agriculture, said the Mama Kitchen Garden is rooted in the belief that women, families, and communities have the power to transform their lives through self-reliance and nutrition-focused farming. “Our vision is that every household—regardless of income or space—can cultivate a small garden and enjoy the dignity of healthy, homegrown food,” she stated. Key stakeholders present at the event—including KALRO Director General Dr. Eliud Kireger and Kenya Seed Company Managing Director Sammy Chepsiror reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Mama Kitchen Garden and scaling up food security solutions across Kenya. The official launch of the National Mama Kitchen Garden is scheduled for 9th May, 2025, at the Agriculture Training Centre (ATC) in Koibatek, Baringo County."

In an address to the military during his first visit to northern Nigeria since a brutal uptick in jihadist attacks, which killed at least 100 people in April, Tinubu said “threats of terrorism, banditry and insurgency have persisted for too long”. “Nigerians are counting on you to end this menace and reclaim every inch of our country,” he said. “Let the enemies of Nigeria know their time is up.” He told soldiers in the northern state of Katsina that his government was taking “steps to equip you with advanced equipment, necessary technological advancement, superior intelligence and robust logistical support, not only to defend this nation, but to dominate and defeat every adversary”. Nigeria’s armed forces have been fighting Islamist militants since the conflict with Boko Haram started in 2009. They’ve achieved territorial gains and succeeded in neutralising key jihadist commanders, but 16 years later, Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province still demonstrate significant resilience, analysts say. There are also criminal gangs — locally called bandits — that terrorise communities in northwestern and central Nigeria by raiding villages, killing, kidnapping for ransom and burning homes after looting them. Nigeria has also come under criticism for military strikes that have mistakenly killed hundreds of civilians. In January, a military airstrike killed at least 16 people in northwestern Zamfara state after an army jet mistook local vigilantes for criminal gangs active in Zamfara state. In December 2023, a Nigerian military airstrike mistook a Muslim religious gathering for bandits in northwestern Kaduna state. That attack killed at least 85 people, mainly women and children."
Senegal revokes immunity for two MPs over alleged Covid funds graft,https://www.kbc.co.ke/senegal-revokes-immunity-for-two-mps-over-alleged-covid-funds-graft/,2025-05-02T21:59:44+03:00,"Covid funds,Covid-19","Senegal’s National Assembly on Friday lifted parliamentary immunity for two opposition MPs over alleged embezzlement linked to Covid funds while they were ministers under the former government. Moustapha Diop was the minister of industrial development while Salimata Diop was the women’s affairs minister under former president Macky Sall when the fund to fight the spread of Covid-19 was established in 2020 and 2021. They have both rejected the accusations against them. The pair are among at least six ministers from the former government whose cases have been referred to the National Assembly by the courts, for alleged misappropriation of funds linked to Covid. Several investigations are currently under way in Senegal against former government officials. The fund, amounting to one trillion CFA francs ($1.7 billion) issued by the Senegalese state and donors, was supposed to reinforce the healthcare system, support households and the private sector and protect jobs in the west African nation. But a December 2022 report by the Court of Auditors revealed a multitude of irregularities, such as 2.7 billion CFA francs in over-invoicing of rice purchased for disadvantaged households and some 42 million CFA francs for gel sanitiser. – Legal action? –
The revoking of the two MPs’ immunity was adopted Friday in a vote backed by a majority of the 165 members of the National Assembly, which is controlled by the ruling party. Moustapha Diop was accused of spending 2.5 billion CFA francs in cash to buy face masks, “a violation” of accounting rules, according to authorities. “My department managed the 2.5 billion CFA francs within the rules. The suppliers said they had been paid in full and delivered all the masks. They said they had given us nothing to bribe us,” he told his fellow MPs, defending himself. His parliamentary immunity had been lifted at the end of March in a separate case for “laundering and misappropriation” of public funds. An accountant from a public institution, currently in prison for “alleged embezzlement”, claimed to have given him 300 million CFA francs to finance his campaign in the November 2024 legislative elections. Salimata Diop also defended herself against what she called as “misleading accusations”, in having to justify expenses of more than 57 million CFA francs. “I have never taken a single franc from the State of Senegal,” she told journalists Friday. Once their immunity has been lifted, the Assembly must vote to bring them before the High Court of Justice (HCJ), a special court empowered to try presidents and members of the government for offences and crimes committed in the exercise of their functions. They must first go before a High Court investigating committee, which will decide whether to refer them to the special court for trial. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, elected in March 2024, and Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko have vowed to break with the old system of governance and fight corruption."
South Sudan security ‘markedly worsened’: western embassies,https://www.kbc.co.ke/south-sudan-security-markedly-worsened-western-embassies/,2025-05-02T21:54:23+03:00,"Britain,Canada","The embassies of Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Britain, United States and European Union said Friday that South Sudan’s political and security situation has “markedly worsened” in ways not seen since the end of the country’s civil war. Months of clashes between President Salva Kiir’s forces and those loyal to the first vice-president Riek Machar, who was arrested in March, have stoked fears of a return to the civil war that only ended in 2018 after claiming some 400,000 lives. The deal ending the five-year conflict has looked increasingly fragile as Kiir’s allies have accused Machar’s allies of fomenting unrest in Nasir County, Upper Nile State, in league with the so-called White Army, a loose band of ethnic Nuer armed youths. In a joint statement, the embassies said they “strongly concur” with a recent assessment by the Chairman of the Revitalised Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) — the body supervising implementation of the peace deal — noting “the political and security situation in South Sudan has markedly worsened in ways not seen since 2018”. The RJMEC quarterly report said on Monday that “in scenes not seen since the signing of the R-ARCSS over six years ago”, a reference to the peace deal, armed conflict and violence had “erupted across the country” with opposition politicians detained and Machar under house arrest. The embassies warning follows a recent government statement listing nine counties that contain the Nuer ethnic group as “considered hostile”, meaning aligned with Machar’s party. The move was labelled by an opposition politician as “nothing short of a mapping for genocide”. The embassies said they “deplore” such a move by the government. The statement also reaffirmed their “urgent call” for Machar’s release, as well as urging all leaders “to end the use of violence as a tool for political competition” and to return to dialogue “urgently aimed at achieving a political solution”. Since March the violence has led to the deaths of at least 200 people across several South Sudan states and displaced around 125,000 more, according to the United Nations. International bodies have increasingly sounded the alarm over the situation, which since declaring independence in 2011 has battled chronic instability and insecurity."

The fatal stabbing in the small southern village of La Grand-Combe on Friday last week prompted President Emmanuel Macron to insist there was no place for religious hate in French society. On Friday, some 700 faithful gathered in the crowded Khadija Mosque and on a nearby lawn for Cisse’s funeral. Worshippers prayed in front of the coffin covered by a green cloth. Cisse was originally from the town of Yaguine in southwestern Mali, where he is due to be buried at a later date. “This is an absolutely incredible act of hatred in a very peaceful place,” Dominique Sopo, a representative of campaign group SOS Racisme, told AFP. On Monday, French authorities said they were investigating the killing as a suspected premeditated murder on grounds of race or religion. A man suspected of stabbing Cisse dozens of times and then filming his victim writhing in agony has surrendered to police in Italy after nearly three days on the run. A French national of Bosnian origin, he is now awaiting extradition to France. France is home to the largest Muslim community in the European Union, and the murder has put Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, a hardline right-winger with a tough stance on immigration, under particular pressure. He conspicuously did not visit the scene of the killing in La Grand-Combe and has been criticised for not finding the time to meet Cisse’s family. Speaking to CNews, a broadcaster accused of fostering far-right views, Retailleau earlier this week said it was “difficult” to find Cisse’s family because he lived in France without a residence permit. He said that “Aboubakar Cisse was in an irregular situation.” French lawmakers on Tuesday observed a minute’s silence to honour Cisse and some lawmakers met with his relatives. According to a source close to the case, Retailleau will meet with members of Cisse’s family in Paris on Monday. French prosecutors have identified the suspect as Olivier Hadzovic, 21. In the video made just after the stabbing, the killer congratulated himself, saying “I did it” and insulting “Allah”, the Arabic term for God. A man identified as the suspect’s father told broadcaster BFMTV on Friday: “My son is crazy. What he did is 100 percent not normal.” He added: “I apologise to the family… I’m sorry.” The lawyers representing the victim’s family want French authorities to have the investigation reclassified as a murder with “terrorist” motives. Mourad Battikh, one of the lawyers, said there was “no doubt” that the murder was “a terrorist attack”. “The Muslim community must be treated in the same way as any other citizens,” he said. French prosecutors were scheduled to speak to journalists on Friday evening."
Iran says US sanctions ‘will not change’ policy after Trump warnings,https://www.kbc.co.ke/iran-says-us-sanctions-will-not-change-policy-after-trump-warnings/,2025-05-02T19:23:51+03:00,"iran,Nuclear deal","Iran said Friday that continued US sanctions on its trade partners will not alter its policy, after President Donald Trump threatened to penalise countries or individuals dealing in Iranian oil. “The continuation of these illegal behaviours will not change Iran’s logical, legitimate and international law-based positions,” a foreign ministry statement said, condemning what it called “pressure on Iran’s trade and economic partners”. It added that such sanctions have created “deep suspicion and mistrust about the seriousness of America on the path of diplomacy”. On Thursday, Trump vowed to enforce sanctions and called for a global boycott of “any amount” of Iranian oil or petrochemicals. “All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions,” he added. His remarks came after Iran confirmed the postponement of the next round of nuclear talks with the United States, which had been expected to be held on Saturday, with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons”. Oman said the date for a new round “will be announced when mutually agreed”. – ‘Just and balanced deal’ –
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who headed the Iranian delegation in the three rounds of talks held so far, said Iran was ready for a “just and balanced deal”. “There is no change in our determination to secure a negotiated solution,” Araghchi said on X, adding that any deal should guarantee “an end to sanctions.” The talks mark the highest-level contact on Iran’s nuclear programme since Trump abandoned a landmark accord between Tehran and major powers in 2018. The US president had written to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in March urging negotiations but warning of potential military action if they failed. Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” policy of sanctions against Iran, with the latest announced on Wednesday and targeting seven companies accused of transporting Iranian-origin petroleum products. Tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme soared after Washington withdrew from the 2015 deal with major powers which offered Tehran sanctions relief in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities. Iran adhered to the agreement for another year before beginning to roll back its compliance. Western governments have since accused Tehran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition it has consistently denied, insisting that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. On Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Iran was “on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons”. He also warned that UN sanctions against Tehran — lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal — could be reimposed if Iran’s nuclear activities were seen to threaten European security. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the French foreign minister’s remarks were “simply absurd”. “This false statement, coupled with the minister’s open threats to reimpose sanctions, reinforces the suspicion that France’s nagging posture risks evolving into a spoiling role.”"
Individuals exploiting insecurity for personal gain – Murkomen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/individuals-exploiting-insecurity-for-personal-gain-murkomen/,2025-05-02T19:24:32+03:00,,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen  stated Friday that certain individuals are profiting from incidents of insecurity in the country by exploiting these situations to fulfil their own selfish interests. While addressing a security meeting in Kambi Samaki, Baringo County, Murkomen expressed his awareness that some individuals have been using insecurity for personal gain, thereby undermining efforts to restore peace and stability. “Insecurity is enriching those who want to be rich to punish the poor in marginalized areas. This is the case in Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, and Marsabit counties,” he said. He condemned the actions of those taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of others in society to further their own agendas. “We are being unfair. Wengine wetu tumepata masomo na kazi. Sasa we are spending time kuumiza watoto wa watu wengine. Some of us mko na watoto boarding school, wengine wako international system, lakini mnatumia watoto wa watu wengine who have nothing. This should prick our consciences,” he asserted. “How is it possible that since 2005 up to now, 20 years down the line, almost Ksh.2 billion from CDF has gone to Tiaty Constituency, and there is no secondary school in a whole location called Silali? There must be something wrong. It means insecurity is enriching other people because resources are not being accounted for,” the CS explained. He cautioned that the state would not passively observe as others use their influence to promote criminal activities. “Kuna wanasiasa wanapenda kuchochea watu. Mimi sitaangalia mtu kama ni wa siasa au la. Bora mtu amechochea wakenya mpaka wengine wamepoteza maisha yao, they will be dealt with just like any other criminal,” he warned. Murkomen noted that the government’s operation launched in Baringo and surrounding counties is showing significant results. “Hii operesheni ya kumaliza uhalifu imefaulu kwa asilimia kubwa sana. Mifugo takriban 7,000 wamerejeshwa, bunduki zaidi ya 200 zimetwaliwa, na watu 200 wanaotekeleza uhalifu pia wameshikwa,” he stated."

Upon her arrest, the detectives opened her luggage only to find 1.3 kilograms of Cocaine “Upon opening them, detectives found a white powdery substance neatly packed and wrapped in yellow cellotape, definitely not your average souvenir.

Autopsy on slain Kasipul MP set for May 5th,https://www.kbc.co.ke/autopsy-on-slain-kasipul-mp-set-for-may-5th/,2025-05-02T16:11:01+03:00,"DCI,Kasipul MP Charles Ong'ondo Were","An autopsy on the body of the late Kasipul Member of Parliament Charles Ong’ondo Were will be conducted on Monday, May 5th, 2025. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the exercise will be led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor. “An autopsy led by Chief Government Pathologist Dr. Johansen Oduor is scheduled for Monday, May 5, 2025, to provide further insights into the cause of death and support the investigation,” the DCI said Friday through a statement. The investigative agency said that it had forensically reconstructed the late MP’s movements from Parliament before meeting his death. Ong’ondo Were was shot dead on Wednesday by unknown gunman along Ngong Road who was reportedly on a motorcycle. According to DCI, its investigations which are currently ongoing have yielded significant leads, enabling detectives narrow down to potential suspects. “While the motive for this heinous act remains under investigation, preliminary investigations suggest that this was a premeditated act. The DCI is pursuing all angles to uncover the circumstances surrounding this incident,” the statement further read. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
New roads bring life back to Nyandarua farms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-roads-bring-life-back-to-nyandarua-farms/,2025-05-02T15:49:00+03:00,"Deputy President Kithure Kindiki,Nakuru County","For farmers in Nyandarua County, the struggle has never been with their crops, it has always been with the roads. Each day, they battle rough, broken and at times flooded roads just to get their produce to market. These roads have long stood between them and fair returns for their labour. But change is finally returning to the highlands. During a recent inspection of the Tumaini-Gwa Kiongolong-Kabazi stalled road connecting Nyandarua and Nakuru counties, Deputy President Kithure Kindiki delivered a strong message of reassurance: the era of abandoned infrastructure projects is over. The road project, which spans approximately 27.5 kilometers, is located primarily in Nyandarua County, with a small section extending into Nakuru County. It consists of three key segments: the Tumaini–Gwa Kiongo stretch (12 km), Gwa Kiongo–Gituamba (8 km) and Gituamba–Kabazi Shopping Centre (7.5 km). “President William Ruto has sent us here to check on this road,” said Kindiki. “I want to assure the people of Nyandarua that this road will not stall again. It will be completed.” For the region’s smallholder farmers, who grow cabbage, carrots, potatoes and rear dairy cows, good roads mean more than just convenience. They mean survival. Poor infrastructure has resulted in rotting produce, exploitative pricing from middlemen and long, gruelling journeys to reach far-off markets. “This road, once complete, will ensure our farmers can deliver their produce fresh and on time.” The Deputy President’s visit to Ol Kalou was part of a broader infrastructure inspection tour across the country. He noted that this road is one of several being revived in the region, including in Ndaragwa, Kipipiri, Ol Jorok and Kinangop. “This is not just about Nyandarua. It’s about opening up Kenya for business and economic growth,” he said. But the government’s plan doesn’t stop at roads. Kindiki also announced the construction of modern market facilities in Ol Kalou and beyond. These new markets will include cold storage and proper infrastructure to help traders, especially women and youth, reduce losses and boost incomes. “Traders will not suffer losses because they will be equipped with facilities to preserve the produce,” said Kindiki. In addition, Nyandarua is among the counties benefiting from the government’s last-mile electricity connection project. The initiative aims to ensure that every village has access to power, lighting up homes, supporting businesses and enhancing education. “As a government, we are working to make the lives of the people better. It’s not time for politics, but at the right time we will fully delve into it,” the Deputy President emphasised. “My work is to assist the President to deliver roads, markets, better prices for farm produce and development projects to every part of the country. That is my work!” For the farmers and traders of Nyandarua, the visit was more than a political gesture. It was a sign that long-standing promises are finally being fulfilled. Under the Kenya Kwanza administration’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), infrastructure development is a key pillar for unlocking growth in agriculture, MSMEs and housing. Improved road networks are expected to ease movement, reduce post-harvest losses and boost incomes, especially in rural and agricultural regions. From dusty roads and spoiled crops to market stalls with cold storage and electrified homes, Nyandarua is on the move, from hardship to hope."

Speaking at Athi River Primary School during the Chief’s Climate Action Day, Dr. Omollo emphasized that protecting children from early school leaving, drugs, and exploitation must take precedence in national discourse. “Our children are our greatest resource. We cannot afford to lose them to drugs, crime, or hopelessness. Parents have sacrificed so much to keep them in school. As government, we are committed to ensuring that every child not only attends school but is protected from all forms of exploitation,” he said. He urged national government administrators to work closely with school leadership, parents’ associations, and religious groups to keep children in class and prevent school dropouts, noting that the Ministry will intensify interventions at the local level. Dr. Omollo also condemned the rising cases of drug and substance abuse, especially along highway towns like Athi River, which expose children and youth to illegal activities. He warned traffickers and unscrupulous businesspeople that the government will not allow a generation to be destroyed for profit. At the same event, the PS led a symbolic tree planting exercise under the Chief’s Climate Action Day, a monthly national initiative aimed at achieving President William Ruto’s vision of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He praised Machakos County for being among the best-performing regions despite environmental challenges. “We came here not just to plant trees, but to plant hope and restore dignity. Education and climate action go hand in hand because without a safe, educated generation, we cannot talk about sustainable development,” he noted. Dr. Omollo called on local industries in Machakos to support education and environmental programs, stating that private sector players must invest in the communities they operate in. The event brought together county officials, the leadership of Athi River Primary and Junior Secondary schools, chiefs and assistant chiefs, and representatives from NACADA and NDOC."

Speaking in Nairobi during World Press Freedom Day 2025, celebrations themed, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Media and Press Freedom”, Kenya Editors’ Guild President, Zubeidah Kananu raised alarm over the growing threat Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses to press freedom. She warned that while AI can be a powerful tool for journalism, it also carries the risk of deepening disinformation, hate speech, and harmful content, eroding public trust in the media. “In recent days, there have been growing calls to control digital spaces-some driven by concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. But we must tread carefully. Kenya already has existing laws which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms.” Said Kananu. Kananu also noted that Kenya already has existing laws, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, which, if properly and fairly enforced, provide a legal framework to address many of these challenges without infringing on constitutional freedoms saying we don’t need more restrictions, but better enforcement and transparency. Adding that: “What we need is not more restrictions, but better enforcement, transparency, digital literacy, and stronger content moderation policies developed in consultation with stakeholders-including the media, civil society, and tech platforms.” On his part, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Editor-in-Chief, Samuel Maina, remarked that professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace adding that to remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism. “We are at a turning point-professional media is slowly ceding ground to the digital marketplace. To remain relevant, we must prioritise ethical journalism, fact-checking and content that serves the public good” EIC Maina noted. Adding that: “AI may transform how we tell stories, but it must not replace the soul of journalism integrity, context and public accountability. Let us harness innovation without compromising trust or professionalism.” Speaking at the same forum, the National Police Service (NPS), through its Directorate of Corporate Communications Muchiri Nyaga, underscored the importance of a constructive and collaborative relationship between the police and the press. He acknowledged the NPS as a key source of public information and reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to supporting journalists in their work. Nyaga warned that police officers would be held individually accountable for any misconduct toward media practitioners. At the same time, he reminded the press of their duty to uphold professional ethics, noting that misuse of press freedom to undermine national security would face legal consequences."

The vehicle was found with 8,000 litres of illegal ethanol carefully concealed under cartons of milk in an apparent attempt to deceive law enforcement. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA), led by its CEO Dr. Anthony Omerikwa, speaking at the scene, said. “This was not just an attempt to break the law; it was an intentional move to endanger lives,” Dr. Omerikwa said. “We will not relent in pursuing those involved in the manufacture, trafficking, and sale of illegal or uncustomised substances. Their assets will be traced and seized under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering framework.” Samples of the seized liquid have been dispatched to the Government Chemist for analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest the ethanol was being trafficked for possible use in the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Dr. Omerikwa commended the swift action and coordination by the local police command and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), stating, “This successful operation is a testament to what inter-agency collaboration can achieve. I applaud our partners in the police and KRA for their vigilance and commitment to public safety.” He emphasised the need for enhanced intelligence sharing across government agencies, noting, “More seizures and apprehensions are possible if we break silos and pool our efforts. The networks fueling this trade thrive on communication gaps. We must close them.” The CEO further urged the public to be part of the fight by reporting suspicious activity anonymously through NACADA’s toll-free hotline 1192. “Community support is crucial. Let us protect our youth and safeguard the future,” he said. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origins and intended destination of the intercepted substance as NACADA and its partners ramp up efforts to dismantle the networks behind Kenya’s illicit drug trade."

The training program undertaken through collaboration between the National and the County government targeted rice farmers from the expansive Mwea Rice Irrigation Scheme, horticulture, as well as tea and coffee farmers. Governor Anne Waiguru said that the county has been educating farmers on use and reduction of agrochemicals especially in horticultural produce such as tomatoes and French beans.  “Statistics have shown that cancer cases in our county are on the rise and since we are not sure of the cause, we are putting effort to reduce use of chemicals on our produce and see whether we can arrest the challenge.” Said the governor, pointing out that besides campaigns on safe use of pesticides, her administration has also been training farmers to undertake organic farming, an effort that is bearing fruits. Safe use of agrochemicals involve practices that minimize risks to human health, the environment or non-targeted organisms while ensuring effective application for pest and disease control. Speaking during one of the training sessions in Mwea, the County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Agriculture, Dr. John Gachara, emphasized the importance of the initiative, noting that improper use of pesticides has been a major challenge particularly among small holder farmers hence the need for sensitization on the matter. “Many farmers misuse chemicals, leading to hazards that affect both them and consumers,” he said pointing out that the county has also trained agricultural extension officers as well as 112 recently recruited agripreneurs who have been pivotal in equipping farmers with the right knowledge on agrochemicals.  Gachara noted that proper use of agrochemicals would go a long way in mitigating health risks and improving the quality of agricultural produce in the county. Kirinyaga is predominantly an agricultural county with about 80 percent of its population practicing agriculture. The initiative that targeted all major farming cooperatives across the county is aligned to Governor Waiguru’s broader agricultural agenda, which seeks to empower farmers through knowledge, resources, and sustainable farming techniques that will enhance food safety standards while boosting farmers’ productivity and market access. Julian Wairimu, a representative from the Mwea Irrigation Water Users Association, highlighted the importance of the training in as far as eradicating unsafe use of pesticide use and safeguarding the health of users and consumers was concerned, thanking governor Waiguru for the initiative. Peter Chege, another leader from the association, acknowledged the significance of the initiative. “We are collaborating with the government to train our farmers on the safe use of pesticides and this training will ensure that the food we produce for local and international markets meet the international safety standards.” He said. Julian Wairimu, a youthful farmer from Mwea said she was very excited for being part of the campaigns on safe use of agrochemicals so as to safeguard the health of produce consumers. Some of the elements that the farmers have been trained on include correct product selection, personal protection equipment as well as chemical handling. They were also taught on duration of harvesting diverse crops after pesticide application. These are practices all aimed at reducing the potential negative impacts of agrochemicals while maximizing their effectiveness in crop management."

Speaking during a strategy meeting with the Directorate of Policy, Digital Health, and Innovations, Medical Services Principal Secretary Dr. Ouma Oluga stressed that restoring public trust in the health system is non-negotiable. “Our work must restore order to the health sector, promote the health of our people, reduce the burden of disease, and lower mortality rates,” Dr. Oluga stated. “UHC implementation must be seamless and impactful to regain public confidence.” Dr. Oluga emphasized that change requires a new way of doing things, urging all staff to engage fully and work collaboratively. “Everyone must contribute and work together. Public trust depends on how we show up, how we deliver, and how we lead.” He urged staff to reflect on the Ministry’s role in terms of policy, emphasizing that everything they do must be secured and maintained for the benefit of Kenyans. “What you do must outlive you. The work of the State Department of Medical Services does not exist in isolation. It must align with the broader Ministry agenda. It is essential that we deliver the full mandate of this State Department and work together to achieve our collective goals.” Dr. Oluga stressed the importance of reorganizing and strengthening health systems to achieve better outcomes, calling on teams to prioritize actions that have real, measurable impact. “Our challenge is not a lack of resources it’s how we prioritize. We must focus on what works and scale it.” He highlighted that innovation must guide both the use of existing resources and the mobilization of new ones. “Let’s be strategic. We must align our efforts with the government’s health agenda to stay focused on what the country expects us to achieve.” Committed to fostering collaboration and accountability, Dr. Oluga reaffirmed his open-door policy and emphasized that institutional stability relies on discipline, adherence to rules, and a strong work ethic. “Apply yourself fully to the task at hand. Discipline, commitment, and clarity of purpose are key.” Dr. Oluga reminded the staff that meaningful change often comes from simple, consistent actions. “Real transformation isn’t always about complex solutions. Sometimes, it’s the simple things we do consistently that create the greatest impact. We need big, straightforward ideas that will have a ripple effect across the system.”"
Europe seems to be revising its history of the Second World War,https://www.kbc.co.ke/europe-seems-to-be-revising-its-history-of-the-second-world-war/,2025-05-03T01:43:47+03:00,,"A number of European Union countries, on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Hitler’s Germany, launched a campaign to revise the results of World War II and discredit Russia’s role in the victory over Nazism. The German Foreign Ministry banned Russian diplomats from laying flowers at the monuments and mass graves of Soviet soldiers, while the top leadership of the European Commission attempted to coerce the leaders of several states liberated from Hitler by the Red Army in 1944-1945 into refusing to travel to Moscow for the celebrations through threats and blackmail. The desire of many senior officials in Brussels and some European governments to forget or distort the courage and heroism of the people and army of the USSR reflects not only the current political and economic confrontation between the EU and Russia but also the dangerous tendency to revive in Europe the ideas that caused the fiercest and bloodiest war in human history. It is essential to emphasize that for those who will carefully study the causes and course of the Second World War, without limiting themselves to watching American blockbusters and English-language literature, its history offers many unexpected discoveries. Although in the 1920s and early 1930s, the economy of Germany, which had suffered a shameful defeat in World War I, lay in ruins, and its political system and society were in permanent chaos, the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, who espoused the ideology of racial superiority and hatred, rapidly transformed this country into the most powerful military force in Europe, with advanced industry and unlimited geopolitical ambitions. In a short time, the Third Reich conquered most European countries and defeated the armies of two massive colonial empires—France and Britain. Many of the states targeted by the Nazis either surrendered without a fight or fell to Hitler’s onslaught within days or weeks. Thus, the largest army in the capitalist world, the French, resisted for just over a month before eventually capitulating to Germany, effectively becoming its vassal. The British Empire, while escaping the shameful fate of France, was defeated by the Germans and retreated from Dunkirk to the metropolis, limiting itself to localized clashes with the Nazis at sea and on a narrow front in North Africa. After capturing most of Europe, Hitler’s goal was the Soviet Union, which he hoped to defeat as swiftly as France. However, the Russians fiercely resisted Nazism. Having thwarted the German blitzkrieg, the USSR fought a brutal war against the Third Reich for four years, not only expelling the Nazis from their land but also liberating 11 European countries, including Germany itself, from brutal occupation. For this significant victory, the Russians paid with the lives of almost 30 million soldiers and civilians. During the war, the Nazis carried out genocide against millions of civilians on Soviet territory and destroyed tens of thousands of cities, towns, and villages. It is essential to note that within Hitler’s armies, particularly in SS divisions composed of ideological Nazis, racists, and war criminals, approximately one million citizens from countries captured by the Reich voluntarily served, willingly assisting Hitler in his struggle against the USSR, Britain, and the USA, as well as in the genocide of Slavs, Jews, and other peoples whom the European Nazis considered an “inferior race.” Now that Russia has once again become a geopolitical adversary for the EU, officials in Brussels, Berlin, and many other European countries have decided to relegate the role of the USSR in the defeat of Hitler’s Germany to that of a third-rate ally of the United States and Britain. They present the history of the war in a completely different light, justifying Nazism by claiming that it was defending European civilization from communism. This approach, by the way, is not only a crime against history and the memory of tens of millions of Hitler’s victims, but also allows us to view modern Europe from a new perspective. Russians were by no means the first victims of carefully disguised European racism, which has for many decades preferred to gloss over its own crimes. Countries such as Great Britain and France fought Germany largely with the help of the peoples they themselves had subjugated. It should be remembered that a significant part of the armies of the British and French colonial empires in the two world wars was made up of individuals from the colonies, at the cost of whose lives London and Paris secured their victories. In Kenya alone, the British recruited nearly one hundred thousand soldiers during World War II, and in total, the British and French drafted more than one million men from African colonies to fight against Hitler. Nevertheless, both London and Paris prefer not to recall either their defeats in the early stages of the war or the fact that, without the inhabitants of their possessions in Africa and the Middle East, they could not have counted themselves among the victors over Nazism. This approach, which has become systemic among the European powers, now allows them to obliterate the memory of the exploits and losses of African, Arab, Indian, and Asian soldiers, while attempting to apply the same principle to the Russians. Moreover, the revision of the history of the Second World War paves the way for Europe to forget its own participation in the crimes of the Nazis, to justify collaboration, and to revive notions of its own superiority. It is not at all coincidental in this context that many current heads of the European Commission, members of the German government and parliament, and officials in the Baltic governments are direct descendants of top officers, officials, and industrialists of the Third Reich or its loyal satellites. For those countries and peoples whose contributions to the struggle against Hitler’s Germany, fascist Italy, and imperialist Japan have been carefully hushed up by European politicians and historians for many decades, it is crucial to preserve the memory of their role in the fight against the monstrous ideology of Nazism and to prevent its resurgence under a new guise. In this regard, it must be understood that the war on historical truth that the European Union is now waging against Russia is also a war against many other countries and peoples of the world, which are perceived by Europeans as insignificant, alien, or even hostile."
"Long Rains season ends in May, with warnings of floods and vector borne diseases",https://www.kbc.co.ke/long-rains-season-ends-in-may-with-warnings-of-floods-and-vector-borne-diseases/,2025-05-01T23:02:04+03:00,,"May marks the end of the “Long Rains” season across much of the country, except for the Coastal and western regions, where rainfall typically extends into June. In the monthly forecast, the Kenya Meteorological Department says several parts of the country are likely to experience near-average to above average rainfall, “with a few areas over north Coast and parts of Garissa County expected to receive near to below average rainfall.” According to the Director of Meteorological Service Dr. David Gikungu, even as the season comes to an end, there is a possibility of isolated severe storms over several parts of the country during the month. “Rains are, however, likely to continue into the June, July to August (JJA) season over the Western Kenya and the Coastal region,” says Dr. Gikungu and adds that, “the JJA cool and cloudy season is expected to set in over the highlands east of the Rift Valley, including Nairobi County, with a gradual reduction in rainfall anticipated towards the end of the month over the Northeastern and parts of the Southeastern regions.” Temperature is expected to be warmer than average over the counties of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley and Nairobi, the Coastal region, South Rift Valley, Southeastern lowlands and Northeastern parts of the country. Dr. Gikungu notes that, the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, Central Rift Valley, Northwestern and parts of the Lake Victoria Basin are expected to have near average to cooler than average temperatures. In the forecast the Weatherman says that the near-average to above average rainfall expected over the ASAL areas of Northern and Southeastern lowlands is expected to see improve pasture and browse. “However, pastoralists and relevant authorities are advised to conserve pasture as the season comes to an end to ensure their livestock have adequate feed to last till the next rainfall season.” There is a likelihood of flooding in low-lying areas and flood plains, especially over the Lake Victoria Basin, the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Coastal region as well as in poorly drained urban centers where rainfall is expected. “County Governments are being advised to clear drainages in good time to avert flooding in the urban areas,” says the weatherman and urges the public to avoid driving or walking through flooded rivers or moving waters. “Cases of lightning strikes are likely over the Lake Victoria Basin and Highlands West of the Rift Valley, especially in Kisii, Kisumu, Nandi, Bungoma (Mt. Elgon areas), and Kakamega Counties,” warns Dr. Gikungu and adds that, “The should avoid taking shelter near metallic structures or under trees to avoid the risk of lightning strikes, which could lead to loss of life.” Dr. Gikungu further warns of the risk of vector-borne diseases, like Malaria, around the Lake Victoria Basin, the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, and the Coastal region while flood-prone areas, in the Lake Victoria region, could experience outbreaks of waterborne diseases. He is urging the health sector to strategically distribute medical supplies and insect-treated nets in the affected areas. Dr. Gikungu is further urging for public health education efforts focusing on disease prevention, while enhancing initiatives aimed at promoting Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), activities to mitigate the spread of diseases among vulnerable populations. The anticipated floods in some parts of the country could pose a risk of causing structural damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and poorly constructed buildings, the possibility of sub-standard facilities. The public is being asked to exercise caution while driving in rainy conditions and to refrain from crossing flooded roads in order to minimize the risk of accidents resulting from adverse weather conditions."
"Atwoli to Kenyans: Give Ruto space, time to do his job",https://www.kbc.co.ke/atwoli-to-kenyans-give-ruto-space-time-to-do-his-job/,2025-05-01T18:34:35+03:00,,"Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged Kenyans to be patient and allow President William Ruto the time and space necessary to implement his policies effectively. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, Atwoli emphasized the importance of rallying behind the President to fulfil his promises to the nation. He dismissed claims that President Ruto has lost the support of a majority of Kenyans, calling such assertions untrue. “Hawa Wakenya unaskia wakisema ground ni mbaya, eti si kuzuri, Ruto must go. Lakini ground sio mbaya. Huyo anasema ground ni mbaya hana ground. Tuwache mtu (Rais Ruto) amalize kazi yake,” he stated. Atwoli remarked that all administrations since independence have faced challenges in implementing their manifestos, but this has not prevented them from completing their full terms in office. He believes Ruto’s situation will be no different. “Your Excellency Rais Ruto, usitishike. Kuna watu wanapenda kutisha. Mimi nilikuwa hapa Jomo Kenyatta akiwa president. After three years, we had problems in government. Moi akiwa president, there were many problems mpaka watu wakaimba yote yawezekana bila Moi. Tukawa na Kibaki na Uhuru, na wote wakamaliza ten years yao,” he said. Atwoli asserted that the workers’ union cannot afford to work in opposition to the government, especially given its mandate. “COTU is not a political party. We negotiate for our rights. We are not aspiring to have a president. We must support the government of the day for the stability of the country, which will extend to industrial stability,” he explained. He cautioned Kenyans to be careful what they wish for and called for regulation of content shared on social media. “I am appealing to Kenyans; we must love this country. We have no other country. If this country goes to the dogs, we have no exit route. Kenyans should see what is happening in the DRC,” he warned. “If we don’t regulate social media, (we will be in trouble). It is regulated in countries such as China, Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Kenya cannot be a free-for-all,” he added. During the celebrations, Atwoli indicated that his tenure at the helm of COTU may soon come to an end. “I have been around as a leader in the labour movement in this country for 24 years. Recently, I mentioned to President William Ruto that he will be the last president I serve. I have served all the Presidents of the Republic of Kenya,” he noted. “As you see me here, I am contemplating exiting COTU. However, a section of the executive board has met and made a resolution expressing confidence in me. But this does not mean that as we enter the new year, it will be only Atwoli who can lead the labour movement,” he explained."
Police say MP’s fatal shooting was premeditated,https://www.kbc.co.ke/police-say-mps-fatal-shooting-was-premeditated/,2025-05-01T17:53:13+03:00,Kasipul MP Charles Ong’ondo,"The National Police Service (NPS) says preliminary investigations reveal the fatal shooting of Kasipul Member of Parliament Charles Ong’ondo Were was premeditated and executed with precision. The Inspector General of Police, Douglas Kanja, said the shooting at City Mortuary roundabout Wednesday night is currently a matter of active investigation, So far, no one has been arrested.  Tracing his Last Steps There are two viable routes that the late Kasipul MP Charles Ong’ondo Were could have used after leaving the premises of the August House. The first is driving through Parliament Road to Kenyatta Avenue through Valley Road all the way to the city mortuary roundabout. The other could be Parliament Road through Haile Selassie Avenue to Ngong Road up to the city mortuary roundabout. What was certain was that the legislator in a white Toyota Crown vehicle with number plate KDM 783 A was followed by unknown suspects onboard a motorcycle. Not knowing what would befall him, the lawmaker, alongside his driver and bodyguard, was caught unawares. It is at the Nairobi hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The suspect fired several bullets, perhaps meant to eliminate any chance of survival of the legislator, before jumping onto the motorcycle and speeding into the darkness. This would spark a series of events as detectives combed through his car and reenacted the crime scene. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja, who was at the hospital and Lee funeral home alongside DCI Boss Amin Mohammed, affirmed that a manhunt for the suspects has begun, citing the incident was premeditated and well planned. In February this year, the late Kasipul legislator in an interview with KBC Channel 1 said his life was in danger. No suspects have been apprehended so far as investigations continue."
"Finance Bill 2025 will bring great benefits to Kenyans, says President Ruto",https://www.kbc.co.ke/finance-bill-2025-will-bring-great-benefits-to-kenyans-says-president-ruto/,2025-05-01T17:31:26+03:00,,"President William Ruto announced on Thursday that the proposed Finance Bill 2025 will offer significant benefits to Kenyans. He says the Bill has been thoughtfully crafted to stimulate economic growth, deliver efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and expand opportunities. Courtesy of the new bill, Ruto explained that pensions and gratuity payments for workers in both the private and public sectors will be tax-free starting from the next financial year. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Stadium in Nairobi during this year’s Labour Day celebrations, he expressed the government’s commitment to workers’ welfare. To improve workers’ take-home pay, President Ruto stated that employers will now be required to apply eligible tax reliefs and exemptions directly when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This marks a significant shift from the current system, where these reliefs must be claimed from the Kenya Revenue Authority. In response to the complaint by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli regarding some employers not implementing the 6 per cent minimum wage increase awarded in 2024, the President directed the Ministry of Labour to ensure that employees receive their entitled wages without discrimination. “It’s unacceptable for employers not to implement the minimum wage increase. The Ministry of Labour should ensure this issue is addressed,” President Ruto said. The President also highlighted that the government has made significant progress in addressing the long-standing shortage of teachers by hiring 76,000 over the past two years, with an additional 20,000 tutors set to be hired in January 2026. He noted that his administration has substantially reduced the teacher shortage, which stood at 116,000 in 2022. “We have set aside KSh2.4 billion to hire an additional 20,000 intern teachers starting January 2026,” the President announced. Additionally, he pointed out that the government has allocated KSh1.6 billion for the capacity building of teachers and another KSh1 billion for promotions. “These investments have improved the student-teacher ratio, enhanced literacy and numeracy outcomes, and created stable employment in communities across the country,” he said. Furthermore, President Ruto assured Kenyans of his commitment to advancing the nation’s development. He emphasized the need for leaders to focus on service delivery, noting that elections are two years away. “We can’t make progress as a country if we don’t make the right decisions. I want to promise the people of Kenya that I will always make the right decisions to change the destiny of this country,” he said. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi praised President Ruto’s efforts in transforming the country, stating that Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa. “We should all know that the biggest threat to a nation is not terrorism, but the collapse of institutions. Our institutions have been solid because of the good leadership of President Ruto,” he said. Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua called for an end to sexual harassment in the workplace, urging managers to create safe and respectful environments for all employees. Mr Mutua noted that his office has received numerous complaints regarding harassment and warned that this unethical behaviour must cease. He emphasised the importance of discouraging inappropriate conduct and specifically urged managers to refrain from engaging in sexual relationships with junior staff. COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli appealed to Kenyans to embrace peace and unity, urging them to reject any attempts to sow discord among their communities. He pointed out that residents in some areas of Africa, including Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are suffering greatly due to instability. “As Kenyans, we must guard the peace we are enjoying for the sake of prosperity,” he said. The COTU leader urged employers to implement President Ruto’s directive regarding the 6 per cent wage increase announced during last year’s Labour Day celebrations."
Mudavadi urges Parliament to allocate budget for Kenyans in trouble abroad,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mudavadi-urges-parliament-to-allocate-budget-for-kenyans-in-trouble-abroad/,2025-05-01T15:45:16+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has stated that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly to provide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the funds necessary to assist Kenyans who find themselves in trouble  in foreign countries. Mudavadi said that the government should not be pressured to allocate funds for the rescue of individuals involved in unlawful activities overseas, especially when such resources have not been included in the budget. “We as the government are being pressured by the society when it was the parliament that had the answer. Kenyan society needs to become cognizant of this and we communicate to our Kenyans so that we don’t face further embarrassment as a government when in reality it was the Parliament that had a say on the resources,” said Mudavadi. Speaking during question time at the National Assembly yesterday, Mudavadi highlighted the need for Parliament to allocate resources to enable the Government of Kenya to assist Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in various countries. “It was a constitutional obligation to safeguard Kenyans everywhere and it was therefore important for the parliament to do resource allocation to help the government intervene for the Kenyans in the diaspora,” he stated. The Prime Cabinet Secretary noted that there are over 1,000 Kenyans incarcerated in different countries for various reasons, ranging from misdemeanours to serious offences. “To the innocence or guilt of the individuals who are in this particular question, I just want to we all must be vigilant on this. We will nevertheless take up the matters again with our missions and see what more can be done to assist in enabling Kenyans to have access to legal support so that they can be able to deal with his challenges,” Mudavadi said. He stressed that it is not the government’s desire to see its nationals suffering in foreign prisons, and he acknowledged the need for a collective effort from leaders to inform especially the youth. “We have a demographic where the young people are the ones who are facing this interruption and they constitute 70percent and they are not informed about the consequences. It is our collective responsibility to start conveying messages of awareness to our young people in all our constituencies in the country, that they should be cautious, because getting into trouble there can be very painful. You can be isolated,” said Mudavadi"

The Head of State committed in March 2025 to sponsor ten needy girls from each of Nairobi’s 17 constituencies to join PCEA Booth Girls’ High School in Ngong Forest, a pledge he has now honoured. On Wednesday, President Ruto hosted the students, their parents, and teachers for a breakfast meeting at State House, Nairobi, where he emphasised his commitment to ensuring access to quality education for all children, regardless of background. “This initiative targets girls from needy homes who would otherwise struggle to access education. I instructed the Ministry of Education to identify deserving students, and I will personally pay their school fees,” said the President. The sponsorship package covers tuition, uniforms, and shopping. The President also revealed that he is supporting over 200 students at PCEA Booth Girls’ High School. In support of the institution, the Teachers Service Commission has deployed teachers, further strengthening the school’s ability to deliver quality education. Nairobi leaders present at the event included MPs Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Timothy Wanyonyi (Westlands), and Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris. President Ruto reiterated the government’s commitment to addressing the shortage of classrooms across the country, particularly to facilitate the transition from Junior to Senior Secondary under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). “To support this transition, we are constructing 23,000 new classrooms across the country. Nairobi alone will benefit from an additional 240 classrooms, with Ksh 1 billion already allocated,” he said. He added that the Nairobi classrooms should be completed within 90 days. He also pledged to build a new school in Mabatini, Mathare Constituency, to tackle educational challenges in the area. On the broader support for needy learners, the President announced plans for a joint framework between the National Government and County Governments to facilitate scholarship and bursary disbursement. “I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with the Council of Governors to create a legally sound framework for delivering scholarships through both levels of government,” said Ruto, calling education “the greatest equaliser.” The President also provided an update on the Affordable Housing Programme, saying the initiative is on track and that new homeowners would soon receive keys to their houses. Calling for unity among leaders, President Ruto urged politicians to set aside political differences and focus on delivering development to the people. “This is not the time for politics. Let us use the opportunity we have to transform the nation and deliver tangible change,” he said. Lang’ata MP Phelix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang’o, thanked the President for his efforts to improve PCEA Booth Girls’ High School and support vulnerable families. “You have touched the lives of many deserving parents,” said Odiwuor. Dagoretti North MP Beatrice Elachi praised the President for engaging with grassroots communities in Nairobi, adding, “No other President has done this before.” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch encouraged the students to seize the opportunity and excel in their studies."

The meal was served last week in a government-run school in the city of Mokama in Bihar, one of India’s poorest states, it said. The commission demanded local government officials and police investigate media reports that “more than 100 children fell ill” after eating the school lunch. The incident sparked angry demonstrations from the children’s families. “The news about the children falling ill, due to the consumption of the midday meal, led to the blocking of the road by the protesting villagers,” it said. Free lunches are offered to millions of children in government schools throughout India, seen by authorities as a way to encourage children to continue their education. The commission said it demanded a “detailed report” from senior state officials and the police, to include “the health status of the children”. It said the report, if confirmed, poses the “serious issue of violation of the human rights of the students,” the statement added. In 2013, 23 schoolchildren died after being served a meal laced with pesticides in Saran district of Bihar. The disaster prompted the government to improve food safety in schools."

The facility, established by Thika Cloth Mills, is expected to transform cotton processing in the region, raise farmers’ incomes, and revitalise the textile sector under the government’s Buy Kenya, Build Kenya initiative. Speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony, Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade and Industry, Lee Kinyanjui, hailed the project as a milestone toward economic empowerment. “This ginnery will enhance cotton uptake, improve farmer earnings, create jobs, and ensure a consistent supply of raw materials for our textile industry,” said Kinyanjui. He emphasised the government’s commitment to local production, in line with President William Ruto’s directive that all uniforms for disciplined forces be made from locally sourced fabrics. To support the initiative, the ministry flagged off trucks carrying 80 tons of certified cotton seeds for distribution to Lamu farmers, a move aimed at tackling seed shortages that have long hindered cotton production. Tejal Dhodhia, CEO of Thika Cloth Mills, called the project a mission to empower local farmers. “Lamu is Kenya’s largest cotton-growing region, yet farmers have struggled due to a lack of nearby processing facilities. This ginnery is here to change that,” she said, thanking both national and county governments for their support, including land allocation for the facility. She reaffirmed her company’s dedication to strengthening Kenya’s textile industry. “We believe in Kenyan cotton and the power of local farmers to shape our industrial future,” said Tejal. Local farmers expressed relief and optimism. “We’ve had to transport cotton to Makueni, Kitui, and Meru. This ginnery will save time, reduce costs, and create jobs here,” said Lucy Kimani. Her views were echoed by Njuguna Kangia and Karanja, who described the project as a long-awaited lifeline for Lamu’s agricultural economy. With operations now underway, stakeholders are hopeful that the new facility marks the beginning of a vibrant rebirth for the region’s cotton industry."
Paramilitary shelling hits Sudan’s presidential palace,https://www.kbc.co.ke/paramilitary-shelling-hits-sudans-presidential-palace/,2025-05-01T14:34:45+03:00,"Al-Salha,Khartoum","Sudan’s presidential palace in central Khartoum was shelled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces on Thursday, a military source said, the second such attack on the capital in a week. The RSF, at war with the army for two years, used “long-range artillery” launched from their holdout position in al-Salha, located south of Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate reports of casualties. On Saturday, the RSF targeted the army’s General Command headquarters in central Khartoum, also using long-range artillery fire, according to a military source. The attacks come weeks after the army pushed the RSF out of central Khartoum, which the paramilitary had swept through early in the war. In a major military offensive in March, army forces regained control of the presidential palace, the airport and other strategic areas in the capital. But the RSF still clings to its last pockets of control in southern and western Omdurman. Since April 2023, the war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands, uprooted 13 million and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. The conflict has effectively divided the country in two with the army holding the centre, east and north while the RSF controls nearly all of Darfur and parts of the south."

Kenya’s bold climate goals revealed in new UN submission,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenyas-bold-climate-goals-revealed-in-new-un-submission/,2025-05-01T11:34:45+03:00,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),"Kenya has reaffirmed its position as a continental climate leader with the submission of its Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), outlining a bold vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon future between 2031 and 2035. The government met its submission deadline of April 30, 2025, marking a key milestone in its climate action commitments. The newly submitted NDC details Kenya’s strategy to adapt to the worsening effects of climate change while aggressively cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the NDC is an ambitious goal: to reduce emissions by 35%,  equivalent to 75.25 million tons of carbon dioxide, compared to the projected business-as-usual levels by 2035. This commitment positions Kenya among the few African nations to articulate a clear, long-term decarbonization plan. “This document is not just a report. It is Kenya’s blueprint for building a resilient society where livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems thrive despite the climate crisis,” said Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry. The plan outlines how Kenya will leverage both domestic and international resources to achieve its targets. The country has pledged to self-finance 20% of its climate actions, while seeking global partnerships for the remaining 80%,  through climate finance, technology transfers, capacity building, and participation in carbon markets. To actualise this vision, Kenya estimates it will need USD 56 billion over the five-year period. Approximately USD 10.5 billion of this, or 19%, will come from domestic sources, signalling strong national ownership of the climate agenda. The NDC also underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development, having been developed through a whole-of-society approach involving diverse stakeholders from across sectors and communities. Crucially, the NDC’s implementation period extends beyond Kenya’s current Vision 2030 development framework, and it will be revised to align with the country’s next long-term development strategy once finalised. The submission comes at a time of growing global climate anxiety and provides a rare beacon of leadership from the Global South. Kenya’s call to the international community is clear: back bold action with real support. “With this submission, Kenya invites the world to partner in unlocking sustainable development opportunities that will shape a greener, more inclusive future for all,” Dr. Barasa added."
Public schools to get Ksh21B capitation next week ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/public-schools-to-get-ksh21b-capitation-next-week/,2025-05-01T13:49:46+03:00,"Education Funding,Education in Kenya","The government has confirmed that public schools will begin receiving delayed capitation funds starting next Monday. Julius Ogamba, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, explained that the delay in releasing these funds was due to competition for resources among various state agencies. While schools nationwide reopened on Monday for the second term, they are once again facing the challenge of delayed fund disbursement amid failed promises by the State. School heads and stakeholders have expressed frustration over the government’s failure to release capitation funds on time a move that has affected learning. Ogamba stated that schools would receive Sh21 billion before the end of next week, as public schools are currently experiencing a financial crunch. The Cabinet Secretary attributed the delays to the competition among government agencies for limited resources. This announcement comes just hours after the Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association (KESSHA) warned that learning in schools could be paralyzed due to financial constraints. Ogamba made these remarks during the Inaugural Education Conference 2025 at the Lake Naivasha Resort in Naivasha. “We have been engaging with the Treasury, and we are committed to releasing Sh21 billion for capitation to public schools before next week,” he assured. He also warned school heads against imposing illegal levies due to the funding delays, stating that those found responsible would face disciplinary action. “We are aware that some Principals are collecting illegal levies from unsuspecting parents and this should come to an end,” he said. On the transition of students from Grade nine to ten next year, Ogamba said that the exercise had kicked off with the government engaging various stakeholders. He also raised concern over use of government funds in various projects calling on County Directors of Education to make sure that the funds were well utilized. Addressing the press at the sidelines of the meeting, he called on Heads of Education in counties to address the perennial students unrest in the second term. “We have seen a trend where cases of student unrest rise in the second term and are calling on heads of education and principals to stem this menace,” he said. On his part, the PS in the Ministry Professor Julius Bitok admitted that there were gaps mainly in the issue of capitation that needed to be addressed. “We shall be using the National Education Management Information System (NEMIS) to address the gaps as we continue implementing various reforms,” he said."
Police probe killing of Kasipul MP Charles Were in suspected targeted attack,https://www.kbc.co.ke/police-probe-killing-of-kasipul-mp-charles-were-in-suspected-targeted-attack/,2025-05-01T08:43:37+03:00,"Kasipul MP Charles Were,National Police Service (NPS)","The National Police Service (NPS) has launched investigations into the fatal shooting of Kasipul Member of Parliament, Charles Were, which occurred Wednesday evening along Ngong Road. According to a statement by the police, the incident occurred at 7:30 p.m. near the City Mortuary roundabout along Ngong Road where a white Toyota Crown vehicle, reportedly carrying the MP and two others, had stopped at a red traffic light when a motorcycle with two occupants pulled up beside it. “According to reports confirmed by the Nairobi Regional Police Commander, at around 7:30 pm this evening, a white Toyota Crown vehicle came to a stop at a red traffic light on Ngong Road, near the City Mortuary roundabout.” Read the statement. Eyewitnesses say the pillion passenger dismounted and approached the car before opening fire on the passenger side, where Were was seated. The gunman then quickly fled the scene on the motorcycle, which sped off before any intervention could occur. “Eyewitnesses have indicated that a motorcycle carrying a rider and a pillion passenger stopped alongside the car. The pillion passenger approached the vehicle and fired shots at the passenger side before jumping back onto the motorcycle and speeding away.” Read the statement. The vehicle’s driver and another passenger, who were both unharmed in the attack, rushed the injured MP to Nairobi Hospital, but medical personnel pronounced him dead on arrival. Nairobi Regional Police Commander confirmed the identity of the deceased as Charles Were, MP for Kasipul. “The nature of this crime appears to be both targeted and premeditated,” the statement from the National Police Service read. While condemning the killing, NPS noted that senior police commanders and detectives arrived at the scene of the crime and launched a full-scale investigation into the circumstances surrounding the killing. “At this stage, it is too early to provide further details. Senior police commanders and detectives are at the scene, piecing together the circumstances surrounding the death. National Police Service condemns this heinous and senseless crime and will spare no effort in investigating the matter.” Police are also appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident to contact the nearest police station, a law enforcement officer, or call the toll-free numbers: 999, 112, or #FichuakwaDCI (0800 722 203)."
Nyahururu nurses protest over unfulfilled employment promises,https://www.kbc.co.ke/nyahururu-nurses-protest-over-unfulfilled-employment-promises/,2025-05-01T13:59:18+03:00,"Nurses,Nyahururu","Nurses from Nyahururu Teaching and Referral hospital on Wednesday staged a demonstration in Nyahururu town over what they termed as failure of county government of Laikipia to offer them employment on permanent and pensionable term. The nurses led by the Chairman, Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN), Laikipia Branch Peter Ndiba faulted Governor Joshua Irungu for ignoring their plea despite a return to work formula agreement early this year in January. Ndiba said the nurses are calling upon the governor to honour his pledge of ensuring the contracted nurses are permanent and pensionable employed among other pledges. He reiterated that Governor Irungu had promised to have all the contracted nurses employed adding that they see no ray of hope since it is four months since the promise. The chairman further pointed out that all the 11 promises agreed upon during the return to work formula in January have not been met blaming the county government for ignoring the plight of contracted nurses. Secretary, KNUN, Laikipia Branch, Daniel Wangai said 80% of the nurses in Laikipia are contracted nurses which the county government through return to work formula promised would be employed under permanent and pensionable terms. Wangai lamented that up to now since January the county government has not honoured the promise citing high wage bill which currently stands at 55%. He said the nurses are wondering why high wage bill while most of them are contracted nurses with meager salary. Spelanza Wambui, KNUN, Laikipia Branch treasurer, said many patients are suffering in hospitals not because of their own mistakes or of nurses but because of failure of county government to honour its promises. The KNUN, Laikipia Branch said they are ready to return to work once all the 11 promises agreed upon early this year are addressed."
Any attempt by Britain to undermine peace in Ukraine could have disastrous consequences,https://www.kbc.co.ke/any-attempt-by-britain-to-undermine-peace-in-ukraine-could-have-disastrous-consequences/,2025-05-01T22:59:06+03:00,,"Donald Trump’s proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine, presented by Washington at a meeting of representatives from the US, Kiev, Britain, and France in London, were rejected by the Ukrainian, British, and French governments. Although the US initiatives could halt the bloodshed and maintain Volodymyr Zelensky’s control over a significant part of the country’s territory, Britain and several other European countries insist on conditions for Russia that are obviously unacceptable to Moscow. This stance opens the possibility for the United Kingdom to turn certain Ukrainian regions into a de facto colony, enabling the use of their natural resources, seaports, and energy infrastructure. Such a development would undermine the existence of a sovereign Ukrainian state and, despite the apparent pragmatism of the British, draws them into a direct and unpromising conflict with the world’s most powerful nuclear power. London’s desire to prevent a ceasefire in southeastern Europe could have been deemed rational in earlier times, from both geopolitical and economic perspectives. Indeed, in the territories controlled by Kiev, there are not only significant but also valuable deposits of various natural resources that could generate considerable revenue for British companies and the national economy. Moreover, several nuclear power plants in Ukraine produce electricity, which is in high demand in the European market, alongside a number of gas fields that could also yield revenues with appropriate investment. Several gas and oil pipelines from Russia to the European Union run through the country, and once the fighting ceases, this infrastructure would be a highly valuable asset for Britain, which expects to manage these pipelines in exchange for security guarantees for Volodymyr Zelensky. It is important to note that, although this information is carefully concealed by both Kiev and London, in January the United Kingdom and Ukraine signed an agreement on strategic partnership for the next century. As part of this agreement, Volodymyr Zelensky consented to place a significant portion of his country’s natural resources, energy, and logistics infrastructure under British control. This was indirectly confirmed by extended consultations between the two governments and business representatives on the development of rare earth deposits, which began immediately after the January agreement was signed. These agreements ultimately rendered it impossible for Kiev to strike a deal with Donald Trump, who also sought to gain control of Ukraine’s resources and assets. The main problem in this complex system of arrangements between Vladimir Zelensky and Britain is the complete inability of Foggy Albion to exercise military control over several regions of Ukraine, let alone provide any security guarantees for Kyiv. Even the British press, loyal to Keir Starmer’s cabinet, openly admits that the armed forces of the United Kingdom are in an unprecedented crisis. The former colonial empire has neither the political nor economic resources to extricate itself from this situation. At the end of 2024, UK land forces numbered about 74,000 soldiers, which is 20 times fewer than the size of the Russian Armed Forces. Moreover, of this modest number of soldiers and officers, only 10,000 to 12,000 are in strike units with sufficient training and equipment for local expeditionary operations. Given that Russia has repeatedly emphasized that any foreign troops entering Ukraine will be considered a legitimate target for its army, the British contingent stands little chance against Moscow’s vast and high-tech military machine, which has been trained in high-intensity warfare over the past three years. We should not forget that if troops are deployed to support Kyiv, London would also be at great risk of being targeted by missile attacks from Russia, which, from the perspective of international law and its own security doctrine, would have every justification to respond in this way to an external intervention in the conflict. In such a scenario, Britain would have to confront an enemy that is vastly superior in all respects, and, given the extreme weakness of its army and navy, the Russians would not even need to use nuclear weapons to defeat them. Assuming, even fantastically, that Moscow would accept a significant part of Ukraine becoming a British colony, with its resources falling under the control of Russia’s ancient enemy, the United Kingdom would still find itself in an extremely difficult position. The military conflicts of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have shown that the behaviour of British troops in occupied territories often leads to a wave of uncontrolled violence and a surge in war crimes. It is enough to recall that in Afghanistan and Iraq, British forces committed thousands of extrajudicial executions, murders, robberies, and rapes against civilians, which largely fuelled the growth of resistance to foreign intervention. With the UK government and judicial system overwhelmingly ignoring the crimes of its military, locals and paramilitaries have no choice but to resist with arms. Even if the British contingent does not come under attack from the Russian army and quietly takes control of ports, nuclear power plants, and oilfields in Ukraine, it will inevitably face an aggressive reaction from the Ukrainians themselves, who are unlikely to be pleased that their country’s natural wealth has been gifted to London and that foreign soldiers are running the streets of their cities. In a country where a large part of the population has experienced intense war and possesses a significant number of weapons, the expeditionary forces will have to be on guard not only for a missile attack from Russia but also for shots in the back from local military personnel and rebels. Although the UK is now seeking to play the same role as it did in its heyday by disrupting peace talks and attempting to seize Ukrainian resources, it must be recognized that London’s status as an empire and world power has been irretrievably lost. If Keir Starmer’s government expects Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump to accept the sabotage of their agreements and allow their plans to be thwarted, it will face a harsh reaction from Moscow and Washington, and, should royal troops enter Ukraine, monstrous losses to its own army."

Raging wildfires near Jerusalem trigger army deployment,https://www.kbc.co.ke/raging-wildfires-near-jerusalem-trigger-army-deployment/,2025-04-30T19:54:24+03:00,"Fire,Israel","Thick plumes of smoke billowed above highways near Jerusalem on Wednesday as firefighters rushed to control wildfires that have injured several people and prompted Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare the situation a “national emergency”. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue agency reported that hundreds of civilians were at risk from the worst brushfires in years, with Katz ordering troops to deploy to support firefighters. MDA said it had provided treatment to around 23 people, 13 of whom were taken to hospital, the majority suffering from smoke inhalation and burns. Among them were two pregnant women and two children less than a year old, it added. It said the alert level had been raised to the highest tier. “We are facing a national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilised to save lives and bring the fires under control,” Katz said in a statement from his ministry. Police closed the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and evacuated residents along the route as brushfires broke out again in an area ravaged by blazes a week ago. Communities home to thousands of people have been cleared out. “Our aircraft can’t do anything right now due to the weather conditions… Our goal is to save lives,” fire chief Eyal Caspi said at a televised press conference. “We are apparently facing the largest fire in Israel in a decade.” The police said on X that they had deployed in force around Route 1 and the Jerusalem Hills, asking the public to “avoid travelling to the area”. An AFP journalist at the scene earlier on Wednesday said the blaze was sweeping through wooded areas near the main road between Latrun and Bet Shemesh, and that helicopters were working to extinguish the flames. Bet Shemesh resident Shimon Bitton, 42, said his daughters had been evacuated from school. “Even though we were scared, everything seems to be fine.” Soldiers arrived on the scene mid-afternoon, with many drivers abandoning their vehicles and fleeing as huge clouds of dark smoke billowed from the fire. Communities located about 30 kilometres (19 miles) west of Jerusalem were evacuated, Israeli media reported, airing images of firefighting teams battling fierce flames.

– ‘Worsening weather conditions’ –
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir hinted that arson could be behind the fires, as police said they had arrested a resident of east Jerusalem who was caught “attempting to set fire to a field in the southern part of the city”. But there was no official declaration directly linking the two. Ben Gvir said police would arrest anyone “involved in arson terror”, while also monitoring for unrest. MDA said ambulance teams had been positioned near communities close to the fires and were ready to provide medical treatment and assist residents. A motorcycle unit was ready to offer medical assistance to citizens stuck in heavy traffic, the agency added. High temperatures and strong winds have allowed the fires in wooded areas to spread quickly, prompting evacuations from at least five communities, the police said in a statement. Ben Gvir, who oversees Israel’s fire department, visited the affected area, which is prone to wildfires at this time of year. In a video statement, he said work was being done to bring more assistance to the affected areas and evacuate stranded civilians. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has contacted nearby countries including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Italy and Bulgaria for assistance, according to a statement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said three aircraft would arrive soon from Italy and Croatia to help fight the fires. With personnel stretched thin, Ben Gvir said he had instructed organisers to cancel any evening events tied to Thursday’s Independence Day celebrations that would have required the presence of firefighters. “The decision is aimed at reallocating forces to deal with the fire, strengthening firefighting units in the Jerusalem district, and preparing for the worsening weather conditions according to forecasts,” a statement said."
South Africa sets up inquiry into slow apartheid justice,https://www.kbc.co.ke/south-africa-sets-up-inquiry-into-slow-apartheid-justice/,2025-04-30T19:51:11+03:00,"Apartheid-era crimes,CYRIL RAMAPHOSA","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Wednesday a judicial inquiry into claims of deliberate delays in prosecuting apartheid-era crimes three decades after the end of white-minority rule. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) created in 1996 exposed crimes, including murder and torture, carried out during apartheid but few of these cases have progressed to trial. “Allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes have persisted from previous administrations,” the presidency said in a statement. “Through this commission, President Ramaphosa is determined that the true facts be established and the matter brought to finality,” it said. Led by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the TRC heard over two years harrowing accounts from hundreds of victims and perpetrators of apartheid-era abuse. It granted amnesty to 850 people who confessed to their crimes and also recommended more than 300 cases for prosecution. Ramaphosa would soon announce who would head the new inquiry as well as its timetable and terms of reference, the statement said. The announcement came after 25 families of victims and survivors sued Ramaphosa and the government in January over a lack of justice. They included the son of Fort Calata, among anti-apartheid activists known as the Cradock Four who were abducted and killed by security police in 1985. Lukhanyo Calata, whose father Fort was stabbed to death and burnt, said they looked forward to the hearings and finding out who interfered with the work of the National Prosecuting Authority. “Their dark and dastardly deeds must be brought into light. This is yet another crucial step to help the long suffering families on their journey towards truth, justice and closure,” told AFP.

– Compensation –
The victims’ legal suit sought constitutional damages for the government’s alleged failure to investigate and try the case. “Following discussions involving the presidency, the families and other government bodies cited in the application, there was a joint agreement to establish the commission,” Ramaphosa’s office said. “Government will be seeking a stay of application on these outstanding matters pending the conclusion and outcomes of the Commission of Inquiry,” it said. The rights group representing the victims said welcomed Ramaphosa’s move but expressed displeasure at the mediation not ceding to all their demands. The Foundation for Human Rights (FHR) said it rejected the proposal to use the commission to address victims’ rights and constitutional damages, arguing that only a court can determine such matters. “The applicants are very disappointed at the about-turn of the president,” FHR said in a statement. Critics have long alleged a covert agreement between the former white-minority government and the post-apartheid leadership of the African National Congress to prevent prosecutions. The foundation of the country’s last white president, FW de Klerk, suggested in 2021 that prosecutors halted the trials due to an “informal agreement” between the post-apartheid leadership of the African National Congress and the former government."

Iran hangs man as Israeli spy after ‘unfair’ trial,https://www.kbc.co.ke/iran-hangs-man-as-israeli-spy-after-unfair-trial/,2025-04-30T19:17:41+03:00,"iran,Israel","Iran executed a man on Wednesday after convicting him of spying for Israel and assisting in the murder of a Revolutionary Guards colonel in a trial activists said was unfair and based on a confession obtained by torture. Mohsen Langarneshin, reportedly aged 34, was hanged at dawn at Ghezelhesar prison in Karaj outside Tehran, several human rights groups said. His mother and father held a vigil outside the jail during the night, pleading for his life to be spared, images on social media showed. The Mizan news agency of the Iranian judiciary confirmed he had been put to death in the morning, describing Langarneshin as a “high-ranking spy” who supported operations inside Iran by Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. The rate of executions is again surging in Iran with at least 339 people hanged already this year, according to figures from the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) monitor that include the latest executions. The hanging also comes as President Donald Trump reaches out to Iran for a new deal on its nuclear programme, with the threat of US military action if talks fail to produce an agreement. “Mohsen Langarneshin, who was sentenced to death in an unfair judicial process based on confessions obtained under torture and charged with espionage for Israel, was hanged at dawn today,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam. “The Iranian authorities’ execution machine is accelerating every day, taking the lives of more people,” he told AFP, describing the executions as “extrajudicial killings”. The US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which had campaigned over his case, said Langarneshin had been convicted by a Revolutionary Court presided over by judge Abolghasem Salavati, who is under US and EU sanctions. “He denied all charges, stating that his confessions were extracted under torture,” the group said. The Iran-born British actor and activist Nazanin Boniadi wrote on X: “The bloodthirsty Islamic Republic has executed yet another innocent.” – ‘Do not execute my child’ –
Mizan said Langarneshin was implicated in the killing of Guards colonel Sayyad Khodaei, who was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran in May 2022. Activists also shared a video of Langarneshin’s mother recorded on Tuesday where she makes a plea for his life after a last meeting with her son at the prison. “I just came from the last visit with my son. I need your help. Please pray for my child. May my child be saved. I do not know if he will see sunrise tomorrow.” Insisting on his innocence, she added: “They will not accept our evidence. We have many documents. We have proof of his innocence, but they (the judicial authorities) reject everything.” IHR said that in a phone call from prison, Langarneshin had said he had been forced by security agents into confessing “nonsense” that he had parked a motorbike with a camera mounted on it for surveillance. Western analysts believe Mossad agents do operate inside Iran as shown by sabotage attacks and assassinations, including that of Iran’s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. But activists say the culprits are normally whisked out of the country before Iran’s security services can react, leaving innocent scapegoats to take the blame. According to the New York Times, Fakhrizadeh was assassinated using a machine gun that had been assembled by Mossad agents close to his home and then fired remotely after they had left. In January 2024, Iran hanged four members of its Kurdish minority on charges of spying for Israel. They were convicted of collaborating on a plan to sabotage a defence site in Iran’s third city Isfahan. At risk of execution is Iranian-Swedish academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and sentenced to death in 2017 on charges of spying which his family says are false."

The envoy, Geir Pedersen, was “alarmed” at “the potential for further escalation of an extremely fragile situation” after violent clashes around Damascus and Homs and Israeli strikes near the capital, his office said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had “carried out a warning action” and struck “an extremist group preparing to attack the Druze population” in Sahnaya, outside Damascus, where deadly sectarian clashes erupted overnight. Syria has been rocked by violence between fighters from the Druze minority and armed groups linked to the government, a major challenge for the Islamist authorities who overthrew longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December. Pedersen called for “immediate measures to ensure the protection of civilians, bring about calm, and prevent incitement of communal tensions” in the country. He was also “alarmed” at reports of Israeli strikes, the statement said, adding: “These attacks must stop.”"

Citing Article 221 of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Public Finance Management Act, the Speaker emphasized the legal mandate of Parliament in scrutinizing allocations to the Executive, Judiciary and Legislature laying the foundation for the Appropriations Act. “The Estimates now stand committed to the relevant Departmental Committees and the Budget and Appropriations Committee for in-depth review and stakeholder engagement,” Wetang’ula said. He called for a transparent, committee-led process anchored on public participation, urging MPs to prioritize the strategic needs of the nation and voices of their constituents. The Speaker also announced that the draft Finance Bill 2025, which contains the government’s proposed tax measures, had been received and would soon undergo First Reading. It will then be reviewed by the Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning, which is expected to hold public hearings. During the session, Minority Leader Junet Mohamed addressed growing public confusion over the Finance Bill, dismissing what he called a “shadow finance bill” circulated online in recent months. “What has been in public circulation was not the authentic document but speculation. The official Bill is now before us,” said Junet, who urged MPs to focus on facts and avoid spreading misinformation. He warned against using unverified provisions for political mileage and stressed that opposition to the Bill should be voiced in Parliament. “If you oppose the Bill, do so here not at funerals or before schoolchildren who cannot respond.” Speaker Wetang’ula echoed the sentiments, reminding MPs of the solemn responsibility of budget-making. “You do not look good when you dramatize fiscal debates in public while staying silent in this House.” As Parliament breaks for recess, MPs have been urged to use the time for meaningful budget engagement and thorough scrutiny of the estimates, which will ultimately shape Kenya’s fiscal direction for the next year."
"CS Duale urges SUPKEM to upgrade, accredit health facilities to support UHC agenda",https://www.kbc.co.ke/cs-duale-urges-supkem-to-upgrade-accredit-health-facilities-to-support-uhc-agenda/,2025-04-30T17:06:32+03:00,SUPKEM,"Government has urged the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) to ensure all its health facilities comply with accreditation and upgrade requirements as part of the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen healthcare delivery under the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda. Speaking during a meeting with a SUPKEM delegation led by Chairman Hassan Ole Naado, Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale emphasized the need for faith-based health institutions to align with national health regulations, particularly amid a crackdown on unqualified medical practitioners and implementation of digital health reforms. The CS met with SUPKEM with to explore and strengthen partnerships aimed at expanding access to quality healthcare under the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda. SUPKEM, which has established 20 hospitals, 12 health centres, and 32 dispensaries across Kenya’s 47 counties, is seeking collaboration in delivering maternal and mental health services, particularly in underserved and marginalised communities. Expressing concern over the country’s maternal mortality rates, Duale encouraged the Council to work closely with other Muslim professional bodies, guided by principles of trust and integrity, to accelerate the delivery of quality healthcare at the grassroots regardless of age or economic background. To support the government’s transformative health agenda, the Cabinet Secretary urged SUPKEM to mobilise community registration under the Social Health Authority (SHA) to fast-track the rollout of the Taifa Care model. Duale also briefed the delegation on ongoing digital health reforms, with a focus on regulation and the crackdown on unqualified medical practitioners. He urged SUPKEM to ensure their facilities comply with accreditation and upgrade requirements. He was accompanied at the meeting by the Director General for Health, Dr. Patrick Amoth, and the Director of Primary Health Care, Dr. Salim Hussein."
China’s Shenzhou-19 crew returns to Earth after 183-day space journey,https://www.kbc.co.ke/chinas-shenzhou-19-crew-returns-to-earth-after-183-day-space-journey/,2025-05-01T01:20:26+03:00,,"The return capsule of China’s Shenzhou-19 spaceship, carrying astronauts Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Wednesday. On-site medical monitoring and care personnel confirmed they were in good health. The Shenzhou-19 manned mission was a complete success, announced the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). In a series of precisely timed maneuvers, the Shenzhou-19 crewed spacecraft initiated its return sequence starting from 12:17: the orbital module separated from the return capsule, followed by the ignition of the braking engine. The return capsule then detached from the propulsion module and began its re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. Utilizing the “fast return procedure” – a strategy now common in recent missions – the spacecraft completed just five orbits instead of the usual eleven, shortening the journey home to approximately 7.5 hours. Upon landing, search and recovery teams located the capsule and arrived at the site in a timely manner. Once the hatch was opened, medical staff confirmed that the astronauts were in good health and excellent condition. A record-breaking space journey China launched the Shenzhou-19 manned spacecraft on October 30 last year from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. The spacecraft later conducted a fast, automated rendezvous and docked with the space station combination. The three astronauts stayed in orbit for 183 days, during which they carried out three spacewalks, breaking the previous world record for the longest single spacewalk set by the Shenzhou-18 crew members. The crew set the record during its first extravehicular activity on December 17, 2024, which lasted for nine hours, according to CMSA. Cai has now completed five spacewalks, making him the Chinese astronaut with the most extravehicular activities. Song became the first Chinese astronaut born in the 1990s to perform a spacewalk, while Wang became the first female aerospace flight engineer to enter the space station. Notably, during a previous cargo installation task, the payload adapter became unexpectedly stuck. The Shenzhou-19 crew successfully resolved the issue during their first spacewalk, playing a key role in ensuring the smooth progress of subsequent experiments. The crew also carried out a wide range of space science experiments across various fields, including fundamental physics in microgravity, space materials science, space life sciences, aerospace medicine and space technology."
"President Ruto vows, “I will transform Kenya”",https://www.kbc.co.ke/president-ruto-vows-i-will-transform-kenya/,2025-04-30T16:11:59+03:00,,"President William Ruto has reaffirmed his commitment to transforming Kenya. He underscored his mission to implement lasting changes for the nation’s development. Speaking in Karen, Nairobi, during the installation of Dr Benard Chitunga as the Chancellor of The Co-operative University of Kenya, Ruto reiterated that having been granted the mandate to lead the country, he has a responsibility to bring about change. He assured Kenyans that he will deliver, despite prevailing skepticism. “Many people may not believe what I am saying, but you will be shocked. I am going to confound the naysayers,” he stated. According to the head of state, leadership requires making the right decisions, even if they are not immediately popular. He cited the changes his administration implemented regarding the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). “I undertook to the people of Kenya that I was going to change the savings culture. You all remember that everyone used to pay NSSF Ksh 200 until 2023, and that was okay. Explain to me why Ksh 200 is okay. How is Ksh 200 going to amount to savings?” he posed Ruto defended the decision to increase the amount contributed by Kenyans to the NSSF, asserting that it is already yielding positive results. “We made the right decision. Today, every Kenyan is saving 6% of their salary, and every employer is saving 6% on behalf of their employees. We have some statistics. From independence up to 2023, we saved Ksh 320 billion. That’s in 60 years. However, in just two years, from 2023 to the present, we have saved Ksh 280 billion,” he said. “Uganda has a bigger social security fund than Kenya although they have a quarter of our economy. Tanzania has a bigger national social security fund, even though they have 50% of our economy. Why? Because they made the right decisions about savings,” Ruto explained, providing a comparative analysis of the situation in Kenya and its neighbours. “In Uganda, everybody saves 10% of their salary, and in Tanzania, everybody saves 8% of their salary. But in Kenya, we were saving Ksh 200, and that was supposed to be okay and I was supposed to do nothing about it,” he added. By the end of this year, the president stated that the country will have doubled the amount saved through the NSSF over the past 60 years, and by 2027, a trillion shillings will have been saved “because we have made some bold decisions.”"

"Revised foreign policy to reposition Kenya’s international strategy, says Mudavadi",https://www.kbc.co.ke/revised-foreign-policy-to-reposition-kenyas-international-strategy-says-mudavadi/,2025-04-30T13:32:05+03:00,,"Kenya’s revised foreign policy aims to prioritize the interests of its citizens and reposition the country’s foreign engagements within the dynamic global landscape, according to Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. Mudavadi, who also serves as the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, informed the Senate Standing Committee on National Security, Defence, and Foreign Relations that the overarching strategy is to shift the policy from the confines of the ministry and make it citizen-centred. He stated that anchoring the policy in law with parliamentary input will place Kenya’s interests at the forefront in an ever-changing global environment. “We want our international and diplomatic engagements to help improve the livelihoods and welfare of every Kenyan as we protect the interests of our country which come first.” said Mudavadi. He further explained to the committee, which sought statements about shaping Kenya’s global image, that the swift changes in the global environment necessitated a review of the policy with a focus on pragmatism, foresight, and long-term perspective. “What we are curing is the traditional way of doing things under hidden cameras, we need to be transparent and forthright in our engagements and be accountable to the citizens in our foreign engagements.” said Mudavadi. “Once we actualize the sessional paper, we will adopt a number of reforms including making public treaties and agreements signed with other countries, once approved by parliamentary. This will help the public to understand areas where they feel they can engage and invest abroad among other benefits,” Mudavadi explained. He also informed the committee that transparency in the issuance of scholarships would be a key aspect of the sessional paper, aiming to eliminate the inequality and unfairness seen in the past. Mudavadi stressed that all Kenyans should have equitable access to opportunities that benefit the country, including those available in the education sector abroad. “Every part of Kenya must get an equal opportunity when it comes to sharing of such opportunities like scholarships. Even if we later decide to bond the students in giving back to the nation once they have graduated, this must be done with fairness and transparency. Scholarships are not a military secret. The sessional paper will outline how the beneficiaries will be identified and the criteria will be known for Kenyans to appreciate that indeed there was transparency.” Mudavadi detailed. “We are also looking at how to deal with the unscrupulous travel agents and agencies that lure Kenyans and dupe innocent citizens when it comes to securing job opportunities abroad. We want to put measures that the Ministry will use to sensitize the citizens so that they are not swindled and left high and dry.” added the Prime CS. Mudavadi, in response to a question about protecting Kenyans seeking jobs abroad, stated that Parliament should assist the Ministry in strengthening laws to prosecute rogue agencies. He also emphasised the need to sensitise and caution Kenyans about regions that are no-go zones, where they may face the risk of human trafficking or slavery. “Our engagements with parliament or even other institution is to help save lives. This is a campaign that should be wholesome. The awareness should not be left for the ministry or government, since when Kenyans suffer abroad it pains many back homes.” said Mudavadi. “As a ministry we are also cautioning Kenyans that once you are wheels-up, the moment you land on the soils of the other country, the laws that govern your stay once the plane has landed are the laws of the foreign country.” said Mudavadi as he urged Parliament to help in enacting laws that will help the ministry navigate legal processes for Kenyans incarcerated abroad. “When you get involved in a traffic offense abroad or you are caught in a brawl in a night club then you want the case to be a Kenyan problem, and yet we don’t have monetary provisions to help in dealing with such cases, you are putting us in a tight corner. Especially to our young people who still want to adventure, they need to be cautious of the same.” Mudavadi reiterated He also informed the committee that the sessional paper aims to embed the foreign affairs portfolio within the National Security Council framework, addressing matters related to budgetary allocations and giving the Ministry greater capacity for engagement. Additionally, Mudavadi shared that Kenya is seeking ways to broaden its asset base in its missions abroad. A component of the sessional paper addresses diplomatic appointments, advocating that career diplomats should receive at least 70% of such appointments, with other experienced officers integrated at a minimum of 30%. “Once entrenched in the policy will clear the ambiguity and guide future nominations and appointments.” he stated. “We are facing fiscal difficulties and some of our missions are grappling with financial constraints but we are working on making sure that our diplomatic missions and the diplomats are not underfunded for this can also be very dangerous.” he added. The committee was chaired by Isiolo County Senator Fatuma Dullo."
MKU heightens research for Malaria on expectant mothers,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mku-heightens-research-for-malaria-on-expectant-mothers/,2025-04-30T11:51:09+03:00,"Expectant Mothers,Malaria","The fight against Malaria in Kenya has received a major boost in the area of research, as Mount Kenya University students have the rare opportunity to diversify their research skills of the disease in Germany. According to the University’s Vice Chancellor Prof Deogratius Jaganyi, the program dubbed as Africa meets Bavaria, is aimed at fostering a vibrant research culture among students and contributing to the wider development of the society. “Malaria has been a huge challenge in Kenya and there is a huge need to address it. We are in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) who have supported by equipping MKU’s laboratories as well as offering opportunity for the university’s post doctorate students to undertake research on Malaria,” Prof Jaganyi reveals. Among areas that researchers will give a weighty focus is on the impact of Malaria on pregnant women. The study includes investigating immunity in pregnant women and their fetuses, studying the immune response to malaria during pregnancy, and developing potential vaccines for pregnant women. Additionally, the research aims to understand the interplay between the malaria parasite and immune responses in pregnancy. “Our research focus group is the pregnant mothers and we seek to evaluate the level of awareness on how they can prevent Malaria, especially the issue of transmission of the disease from them to their offsprings. We will be undertaking this in the Coast and Kilifi County specifically when Malaria cases are endemic,” stated Dr. Ngara Chome. The move by the university to invest in research and innovation on Malaria comes at a time the government has issued a stark reminder of the disease’s enduring grip, with the country recording over 5 million malaria cases in 2024. Data issued by the ministry of health indicates that over 70% of the population remains at risk. Further, the ministry says that Malaria continues to hinder the socio-economic development—keeping children out of school, reducing productivity, and increasing household healthcare costs. “Encouraging research at the student level cultivates critical thinking, innovation, and evidence-based problem-solving skills. It also equips students to contribute meaningfully to national and global challenges,” stated Prof. Jesse Gitaka. However, Kenya has made notable headway in its battle against malaria, with national prevalence falling from 8% in 2015 to 6% by 2020. The number of reported cases has dropped from a peak of 9.2 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2023. Once responsible for nearly a third of all outpatient consultations, malaria now accounts for just 16%, according to the Ministry of Health. “Research has become an integral part of the society. A few years we had covid 19 and even today we are facing threats of other diseases, some like Malaria are becoming resistant to current treatments so the research must be carried out continuously,” notes Prof Jesse Gitaka. The researchers emphasized the need for relentless action to meet the national goal of Malaria elimination by 2030. MKU has consistently prioritized research development, with structures such as the Directorate of Research and Innovation supporting students and faculty in pursuing scholarly work. The university’s leadership emphasized that strengthening research output aligns with its vision of becoming a global center of excellence in education, research, and innovation."
From costly treatments to dietary changes: A journalist’s battle with rare condition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/your-condition-doesnt-define-you-it-refines-you/,2025-04-30T10:40:36+03:00,"Alvin Kaunda,AOSD","Alvin Kaunda, a budding journalist, had just landed his dream job at the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). He shot to fame when a baby elephant interrupted his piece-to-camera at an animal orphanage, a hilarious moment that quickly went viral. The clip was picked up by major international news outlets, catapulting him into the limelight and inspiring him to fully pursue his passion for wildlife journalism. “I enjoyed every bit of telling such stories. It was both fulfilling and rewarding,” says the young journalist. However, in June 2024, what initially seemed like normal fatigue from the demands of his work took a worrying turn when he developed a fever, body rash, and joint pain. What followed was chronic pain, prompting Alvin, who was living alone at the time, to travel home to Mombasa for further medical evaluation. During this period, his condition worsened, leading to hospitalisation as the mysterious illness gradually affected his mobility. During a second visit to a different hospital, he was diagnosed with sepsis, a serious medical condition where the body’s response to an infection triggers widespread inflammation, potentially resulting in tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) Although the diagnosis was devastating, Alvin felt a sense of relief that doctors had finally identified his illness and believed it could be treated. However, despite the initial prognosis, his condition failed to improve, leaving doctors puzzled once again. By then, Alvin had undergone over 20 medical tests in a desperate attempt to save his life. Eventually, he was discharged to manage his symptoms at home. During this time, his dreams, career, and love for wildlife expeditions began to fade; his only desire was to get well again. It was during one of his many outpatient visits that Alvin experienced a sudden attack. This was a turning point, as doctors witnessed the episode firsthand and ordered a ferritin test, a blood protein that contains iron and indicates how much iron the body stores. The test results revealed that Alvin had Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), a rare systemic autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks itself instead of providing protection. The disease is uncommon, affecting only about 1 in 100,000 people. Diet Changes Now, ten months later, Alvin, who relies on expensive treatments that include medication and regular testing to manage his overactive immune system, has been forced to make significant lifestyle changes, including a complete overhaul of his diet. “I’m still learning about the condition. There’s no cure for Still’s disease, but it can go into remission, and there is no time frame for this,” he told KBC Digital. “As a bachelor, I used to prefer fast food because it was convenient, but that had to change.” “Junk and processed foods are triggers for flare-ups, so I now stick to fresh ingredients and prepare my own meals, something I never imagined I’d do,” says the journalist, who lost his father to cancer just a month ago. “This condition has been a real eye-opener. The truth is, there are countless benefits to healthy eating. You don’t have to wait until you’re sick to make a change.” “I watched my dad change his diet tremendously after being diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. Since 2019, his eating habits were completely different, and he fought the disease bravely until March 9th, 2025, when he passed away at the age of 57,” he explains. “Living with AOSD, a non-curable condition, has completely changed my relationship with food. My diet is now part of my treatment. It helps me manage flare-ups, inflammation, and energy levels. To my peers: don’t underestimate the power of what you put on your plate. It can truly be medicine,” he continues. Alvin, who at the time of publication was experiencing an episode, further shared insights into managing the condition while reflecting on the financial burden, which he admits ‘feels heavier than the illness itself.’ “My condition requires lifelong management with medications like methotrexate, a type of DMARD (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug), regular blood tests, doctor consultations, and at times, emergency care during flare-ups. These treatments aren’t optional; they are necessary to keep me going and to manage my pain, inflammation, fatigue, and the risks that come with a suppressed immune system. But it comes at a cost. Every hospital visit, every blood test, and every prescription add up. And because AOSD is a rare autoimmune disease, not all treatments are covered or even easily available,” he points out. He adds, “I’m sharing this just to highlight what so many people with chronic and rare diseases face. We fight not only our symptoms but also a system that often overlooks the financial burden of being unwell. Healthcare shouldn’t be a privilege; it should be a right. And rare conditions like AOSD deserve more awareness, better support, and more affordable treatment options.” Although Alvin may have slowed down on his wildlife expeditions, his perspective on life has changed, and he believes every day is a gift to continue raising awareness of Still’s disease and to participate in advocacy efforts primarily focused on NCDs. “I live more intentionally now. Every good day is a gift. My condition has taught me not to take health for granted and to prioritise balance, joy, and rest. Life may not go back to what it was before diagnosis—but it can still be full, meaningful, and impactful,” he says. Warning Labels While many factors can increase the risk of developing an autoimmune condition, nutrition may also influence the risk and severity of these diseases. Concerns are growing over the rising prevalence of diet-related diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, among children and young people—conditions that were previously associated only with older adults. In light of this situation, various stakeholders, including the church (NCCK), are advocating for the promotion of healthy eating habits through policy interventions, such as implementing Front-of-Pack Warning Labels (FOPWL) on food products. This initiative aims to empower consumers to make more informed choices about their purchases. “If Kenya were to adopt black octagonal warning labels on foods with high levels of nutrients linked to NCDs, it would be a step in the right direction to reduce the excessive consumption of junk food, which poses significant health risks,” notes Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist and programme officer at IILA. Their advocacy efforts are yielding results; Kenya, through the Ministry of Health, is set to launch its first Nutrition Profile Model next month. This key document will lay the groundwork for developing regulations that require food manufacturers to display clear warning labels on the front of food packaging, informing consumers about high levels of unhealthy nutrients such as sugar, sodium, saturated fats, and trans fats. Additionally, regulations aimed at countering aggressive commercial marketing that targets NCD risk factors in children and young people will also be considered. Alvin is among those who welcome this significant milestone, hopeful that one day the government will enact food policies and regulations that will save lives. “To the food and beverage industry, I personally feel that they have a massive role to play in public health. As someone living with a non-curable disease, I rely on food not just for nutrition, but for survival. The upcoming nutrient profile model is an opportunity to raise the standard. Create products that nourish, not harm. Label them clearly. Remove harmful additives,” he appeals. He presents another challenge to all: “We should move from marketing what is addictive to producing what is actually healing. Consumers deserve transparency, and those of us living with lifelong conditions deserve better choices. To policymakers: support access to affordable, nutritious food; it’s a basic right. And to others fighting incurable diseases—focus on what you can control, and let food be one of your tools for healing and strength.” He signs off with a heartfelt message of encouragement to everyone navigating life with a chronic illness. ” Your condition doesn’t define you; it refines you. Take it one step at a time. There will be tough days, but you’re not alone. Your strength lies in showing up, even when it’s hard. Find a routine that works for you, and don’t be afraid to advocate for your needs.” WATCH THE VIDEO"
African school children invited to join Arctic Science Expedition on board nuclear Icebreaker,https://www.kbc.co.ke/african-schoolchildren-invited-to-join-arctic-science-expedition-on-board-nuclear-icebreaker/,2025-05-01T17:38:50+03:00,,"Students from Ghana, South Africa, Namibia, and Egypt are among those eligible for the 2025 “Icebreaker of Knowledge” programme Schoolchildren aged 14 to 16 from Ghana, South Africa, Namibia, and Egypt, are invited to take part in the international educational project “Icebreaker of Knowledge”. The most outstanding participants will have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join a scientific expedition to the North Pole aboard the nuclear icebreaker 50 Let Pobedy (“50 Years of Victory” in Russian), operated by Rosatom. The selection process, which opened in late April 2025, is part of the sixth edition of the “Icebreaker of Knowledge” project. This year’s expedition holds special significance as it coincides with the 80 years of Russian nuclear industry and the 500th anniversary of the Northern Sea Route — two milestones that highlight humanity’s ongoing quest for exploration and technological advancement. Schoolchildren from 20 countries across Eurasia, Africa, and Latin America are participating in the competition. The most successful candidates will form an international expedition team and embark on a scientific journey to the Arctic, taking part in lectures, masterclasses, quizzes, and collaborative research activities. For some students, it may become a historic experience, as they will be the first representatives of their countries ever to reach the geographic North Pole. “The ‘Icebreaker of Knowledge’ project gives young people in Africa a platform to show their potential on a global stage. Science knows no borders, and the Arctic expedition is a unique chance to meet peers from different countries, work together on real scientific challenges, and see firsthand how innovation is shaping the world’s future. We encourage students from Ghana, South Africa, Namibia, and across the continent to seize this opportunity,” noted Ryan Collyer, CEO of Rosatom Central and Southern Africa. The final selection results will be announced in June 2025, after which the expedition team will be finalised. Students from Ghana, South Africa, Namibia, and Egypt are among those invited to take part this year. In 2024, a participant from South Africa was among the winners who joined the Arctic expedition, becoming one of the first representatives from the African continent to reach the North Pole aboard a nuclear icebreaker. Since its launch six years ago, “Icebreaker of Knowledge” has enabled more than 350 students to participate in Arctic expeditions arranged by Rosatom. The project is organised by the Nuclear Industry Information Centres (NIIC) with the support of Rosatom, one of the world’s leading nuclear technology companies. Rosatom is actively involved in educational, research, and cultural initiatives around the world, helping to foster new generations of scientists, engineers, and innovators."
Around 600 North Korean soldiers killed fighting for Russia,https://www.kbc.co.ke/around-600-north-korean-soldiers-killed-fighting-for-russia/,2025-04-30T06:59:20+03:00,"MP Lee Seong-kweun,North Korea","Around 600 North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia against Ukraine have been killed and thousands more wounded, a Seoul lawmaker said Wednesday, after Pyongyang officially confirmed deploying troops to aid Moscow. “So far, North Korean troop casualties are estimated at around 4,700, including approximately 600 deaths,” MP Lee Seong-kweun, a member of parliament’s intelligence committee, told reporters after a briefing by the country’s spy agency. North Korea confirmed for the first time Monday that it had deployed troops to Russia, with state news agency KCNA reporting Pyongyang’s soldiers helped Moscow reclaim territory under Ukrainian control in the Russian border region of Kursk. Moscow had separately confirmed the North’s participation, after months of official silence from both countries, even as Seoul and Washington accused Pyongyang of sending ever more troops and weapons to help. Some 2,000 soldiers have been taken back to nuclear-armed North Korea this year, Lee said, and were now reportedly being held in isolation in Pyongyang and at other locations across the country. “It is understood that the bodies of fallen soldiers were cremated locally in Kursk before being transported,” back to the North, he added. North Korea “supported Russia’s recapture of Kursk by deploying 18,000 troops in two phases,” Lee said, adding that the number of clashes in the area had decreased since around March. Since then, “there have been reports of misconduct within North Korean forces, including excessive drinking and theft,” he said. – Combat capability ‘significantly improved’ –
South Korea has repeatedly slammed the troop deployment, and criticised the North for sending container-loads of weapons, including missiles, to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine. The nuclear-armed North has received significant technical support from Russia in return, Seoul claimed. In addition, after six months of fighting, Seoul’s National Intelligence Service estimates that the North Korean forces’ “combat capability has significantly improved,” Lee said. “Early inexperience has diminished and they have become more proficient in using new weapon systems, including drones,” he said. Lee said it was not possible to “entirely rule out” that the North could send more soldiers to Russia. The troops sent to Russia, reportedly from North Korea’s elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Seoul has previously said. Moscow and Pyongyang have boosted their military cooperation since Russia launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The two countries signed a sweeping military deal last year, including a mutual defence clause, when Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to North Korea. Pyongyang launched a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions. Experts have warned that the nuclear-armed North may be testing weapons for export to Russia for use against Ukraine."

He confirmed “at least 15 casualties”. Building fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations. The Press Trust of India news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”. Kolkata’s The Telegraph newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire. Verma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”."

Wearing glasses with a youthful air and ready smile, the cardinal nicknamed “Chito” is a popular figure among the fervently religious country’s more than 90 million Catholics. Born into a working-class family near Manila, Tagle was ordained as a priest in 1982 and became archbishop of the nation’s capital in 2011, a politically influential post in one of the largest dioceses in Asia, where Catholicism is growing. He was made cardinal by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012. A fluent English speaker, Tagle has been mentioned as a possible papal contender since the last conclave in 2013, when Francis was elected, and his name is on everybody’s lips this time around. Underscoring the close ties between the late Argentine pontiff and Asia’s most prominent bishop, Tagle was appointed in 2019 head of a key Vatican department, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples. After Francis reformed the department, he named Tagle “pro-prefect” in 2022, leading the section for “First Evangelisation and New Particular Churches”, with responsibility over new dioceses.

– ‘Trust God’s knowledge’ –
As a bishop, Tagle was known for chatting with the faithful after mass and even inviting beggars to dine with him at his residence. The adjustment to life in Rome and the formalities of the Vatican was not easy — he told theology graduates soon after arriving in 2020 that he “makes the Italians suffer” when he speaks their language. He also once forgot to wear his clerical collar to a meeting. An eloquent speaker with a soothing voice, Tagle giggles at his own jokes and injects self-deprecating humour into his homilies. But he is also known for being outspoken. As archbishop of Manila, Tagle criticised the bloody war on drugs waged by Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ president at the time. “We cannot allow the destruction of lives to become normal. We cannot govern the nation by killing,” Tagle said in a pastoral letter in 2017. Tagle has called for a humbler Church more open to the concerns of its members, and at a 2019 Vatican summit on fighting child sex abuse he pointed the finger at the Church’s top ranks. “Wounds have been inflicted by us bishops on victims and in fact the entire body of Christ,” he told the delegation. “Our lack of response to the suffering of victims, and yes even to the point of rejecting them and covering up the scandal to protect perpetrators and the institution, has injured our people, leaving a deep wound in our relationship with those we are sent to serve,” Tagle said. However, he has been accused of failing to tackle the issue sufficiently in the Philippines. Questions have also been raised over what he knew about the employment in the Central African Republic of a Belgian priest, Luk Delft, by the Vatican’s Caritas Internationalis charity. Delft had previously been convicted of child sexual abuse and banned from contact with children for 10 years. Tagle served as president of Caritas Internationalis, the world’s second-largest charitable association, from 2015 until 2022. In 2022, Tagle and the rest of the leadership team were removed by Francis after a Vatican-led audit found “deficiencies” in management and procedures. In June 2023, the pope appointed Tagle as his special envoy to the National Eucharistic Congress of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He carried out a similar role for the pontiff at the General Conference of the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences (FABC) in Bangkok in October 2022. The cardinal has said he never saw himself as a high-ranking man of the cloth. “If I were God, I would not choose me to be a bishop or a cardinal,” he said in a 2018 interview. “But since I’m not God, God sees something in me probably that I don’t see in myself and I just have to trust God’s knowledge of me.”"
"Pietro Parolin, career diplomat leading race to be pope",https://www.kbc.co.ke/pietro-parolin-career-diplomat-leading-race-to-be-pope/,2025-04-30T05:33:46+03:00,"Cardinal Pietro Parolin,China","A seasoned diplomat who worked with Pope Francis for 12 years, Cardinal Pietro Parolin is well-known in Rome and abroad, and a serious contender to be the next pontiff. The 70-year-old Italian was secretary of state — the Vatican’s effective number two — for almost the entire Francis pontificate, and its most visible exponent on the world stage. With his air of calm and subtle sense of humour, Parolin is the consummate diplomat, a polyglot with experience in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. He played a key role in mediating a thaw between the United States and Cuba, as well as making a key Vatican agreement with China on naming bishops. Parolin is the favourite to replace Francis, who died on April 21, when the conclave of cardinals starts meeting on May 7. He is well known to world leaders and diplomats. Crucially, he also has a fine grasp of the intricacies the Roman Curia, the Holy See’s central government, and was part of a group of cardinal advisors to Francis. His role, and his moderate positions on many social issues, would suggest continuity with Francis if he were to become pope. At the same time, sources say he can reconcile the Church’s different factions. “He’s the best known cardinal of them all. But the question is whether his profile will help create a consensus around him. It could also work against him,” an ecclesiastical source in Rome told AFP, speaking anonymously. The source noted that Parolin “has never had pastoral responsibilities and has taken few positions on societal issues”. “He has remained in a very institutional role. It is difficult to know what he thinks, which could be a weak point.” – From Vietnam to China –
Fluent in French, English, and Spanish, Parolin is approachable but cautious in public, avoiding any statements that could be misinterpreted — unlike the often outspoken Francis. He frequently found himself seeking to smooth feathers after an outburst by the late pontiff, notably on the Ukraine war, when Francis alternatively offended Ukraine and Russia. The Argentine pope appointed Parolin shortly after being elected in March 2013, and made him a cardinal in 2014. Parolin was involved in the Vatican mediation that led to the 2014 resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. He was also integral to the signing of a 2018 agreement between the Holy See and China on naming bishops, which has since been renewed. The accord gave both sides a say on appointments and has been a crucial step in improving relations between the two. However, the deal has been criticised by some conservatives, particularly Americans, who accused Parolin of sacrificing Chinese Catholics forced into an underground Church. Parolin advocates for a similar accord with Vietnam. – A life of faith –
Parolin was born on January 17, 1955, into a deeply Catholic family near Venice in northern Italy. His father managed a hardware store and his mother was a teacher. His childhood was marked by the tragic loss of his father in a car accident when he was 10, and his vocation came soon afterwards. Parolin entered the seminary at 14, was ordained a priest at 25 and then went to Rome to study canon law. He also trained as a diplomat, joined the Holy See’s diplomatic service in 1986 and has spent the last four decades criss-crossing the globe. His missions took him to Nigeria until 1989, then to Mexico (1989-1992), war-ravaged Rwanda and then to Venezuela from 2009 to 2013. Despite his reticence to comment on many societal issues, Parolin has declared that priestly celibacy is not a dogma, and in 2023 described as “indefensible” the attempt to link sexual abuse in the Church with homosexuality. He also described celibacy as a “gift from God to the Church”, has denounced abortion and surrogacy as serious violations of human dignity. Parolin has criticised the idea that gender can differ from sex."
"Sanctions, tariff wars destroying EU economy",https://www.kbc.co.ke/sanctions-tariff-wars-destroying-eu-economy/,2025-05-01T01:12:27+03:00,,"The economic crisis in the European Union continues to intensify amid the introduction of another package of Brussels’ sanctions against Russia and tariff wars with the United States. The largest European concerns are suffering losses due to rising energy and aluminum prices, as well as the possible closure of the U.S. market for their products. Over the past three years since the European Union launched its sanctions war against Russia, the economic situation of even such powerful industrialized countries as Germany and France has been severely tested and suffered huge losses. Large companies engaged in the production of automobiles, industrial equipment, construction materials and other high value-added products, following the pan-European policy of cutting ties with Moscow, have rapidly withdrawn from the huge Russian market, closed hundreds of their local plants, and severed long-term contracts with partners. The very fact of losing sales in a country of 150 million people and the hasty sale of assets caused record losses to European concerns such as Volkswagen, Bosch and IKEA, which had to be either compensated in other markets or covered by cost-cutting. With economic turbulence around the world leading to falling incomes and reduced consumption, European businesses were unable to take the first option, and as a result, corporations were forced to close their expensive plants in the EU and lay off thousands of highly skilled engineers and workers. Besides stopping work in Russia, European industry was also hit by Brussels’ energy policy, which imposed energy sanctions against the Russians, effectively leaving the EU economy without reliable supply channels for relatively cheap gas, oil and coal from Russia. It proved impossible to replace the huge amounts of energy that Moscow had been selling to Europe for several decades, either with American liquefied gas or with unreliable solar and wind power plants, which made the production of a wide range of industrial products unprofitable and even unprofitable. In 2023 and 2024 alone, manufacturers of automobiles and their components, machine tools, steel, chemicals and household appliances announced the liquidation of their factories in Europe or their relocation to the United States, Mexico and China. The situation is no less critical in small business, where the number of bankruptcies over the past two years is estimated in tens of thousands of companies. It is important to take into account that behind every news about the closure of a car plant, metallurgical factory, family bakery or fertilizer production there are thousands of layoffs, rising unemployment and reduced revenues to the budgets of European countries. In addition, the lack of cheap gas, constantly rising prices for electricity, hot water and gasoline, along with rising unemployment, are rapidly bringing the end of the once prosperous life even in the most developed countries of Europe. Another blow to the EU economy was Donald Trump’s broad campaign to impose customs tariffs, which finally undermined the confidence of European businesses in their future. It should be borne in mind that for many sectors of European industry and agriculture, the U.S. market is a key market, and the imposition of even small duties on automobiles, steel, medicines, food or other goods will lead to a sharp drop in sales and multibillion-dollar losses. Although Washington has so far postponed the introduction of increased tariffs, German, French and Italian companies have already lost part of their previous income, the value of their shares has dropped significantly, and the possibility of long-term planning of their work and development has become a pipe dream. In reality, the EU has very few options left to save its own industry, agriculture, incomes and welfare. Normalization of relations with Russia, which can save Europe from the energy crisis and open its market for it, may be the only chance to preserve its industrial power, but so far Brussels is only working on new packages of sanctions against Moscow, which will make it impossible for European industry to buy cheap aluminum, LNG and oil. It is unlikely that trade with the U.S. will be restored until at least the end of Donald Trump’s presidency, and the largest and most profitable sectors of European industry will hardly survive the four years of his rule and will be forced to either completely shut down their operations or move their factories to America, which in any case will be the end of the EU’s industrial strength and the era of its social prosperity. The bitter lesson the EU is now learning is that political and ideological conflicts are poison to economies, businesses and the well-being of nations. The contempt for the interests of their countries that both the European Commission and most European governments have shown in recent years has ultimately cost their economic systems and their voters a heavy price. It can already be stated that the arrogance and careless self-confidence of European politicians have put an end to an entire era of EU prosperity and the work of several generations."

This will involve substantial revisions to the initial budget estimates of KSh4.3 trillion and broader austerity measures. The Cabinet meeting that was chaired by President William Ruto on Tuesday at State House Nairobi, also approved the Finance Bill, 2025, which focuses on closing loopholes and enhancing efficiency. According to a statement from the cabinet, the bill aims to streamline tax refund processes, reduce tax disputes, and amend key tax laws, including the Income Tax Act, VAT Act, Excise Duty Act, and Tax Procedures Act. “Importantly, the Bill seeks to minimise tax-raising measures. Instead, it aims to enhance tax administration efficiency through a new legislative framework.” Read the statement. The Bill proposes critical changes to support small businesses, allowing them to fully deduct the cost of everyday tools and equipment in the year of purchase, thereby eliminating unnecessary delays in accessing tax relief. In addition, retirees will benefit significantly as all gratuity payments, whether in public or private pension schemes, will now be fully tax-exempt, ensuring dignity for Kenya’s senior citizens after retirement. Employers will also be required to automatically apply all eligible tax reliefs and exemptions when calculating Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes for employees. Currently, many employers omit these reliefs, forcing employees to seek refunds from the Kenya Revenue Authority. Similarly, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024 which mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds. “In a move to ensure predictability and strengthen emergency preparedness, the Cabinet also gave nod to the Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This Bill mandates, rather than merely encouraging, all county governments to establish County Emergency Funds.” The statement read. According to the Cabinet, the decision follows the serious gaps exposed by the 2023 El Nino rains and stems from extensive consultations and a directive issued at the 24th Ordinary Session of the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council (IBEC) in August 2024. The Bill further dedicates pension and retirement benefits framework for judges of the superior courts was endorsed, aiming to ensure their financial security and protect judicial independence. “Serving judges will be under a Defined Benefit system, while new appointees will be under a Defined Contribution system. The bill also provides enhanced retirement benefits, including medical coverage and diplomatic privileges.” Cabinet resolved. The Cabinet also approved the construction of two Level VI teaching and referral hospitals in Bungoma and Kericho counties in partnership with the African Development Bank to improve access to quality healthcare. Capital Markets Act Amendments were approved by Cabinet, the amendments are meant to remove shareholder limits in regulated institutions to stimulate investment and deepen financial markets. Additionally, the Cabinet approved the Draft Pest Control Products Bill, 2024 which modernizes the regulation of pest control products, establishes the Pest Control Products Authority, and aims to enhance safety and standards in the sector. The Cabinet approved the establishment of a Consulate General in Port-au-Prince, Haiti noting that the consulate will provide strategic support to Kenya’s leadership role in restoring law and order in Haiti."

Speaking at Broadcasting House in Nairobi shortly after being declared winners to serve for a three-year term, Graham Kirwa, Martin King’asia and Silas Kiragu committed to push for the release of 3.27 billion shillings owed to the scheme by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. The trustees noted the prolonged delays in pension payments and said they would push for swift action to resolve the issue. To show accountability, they pledged to report back to members progress after a one year period. The trio further urged that previously passed resolutions be ratified without delay, to enable the pension scheme to function optimally. The team expressed gratitude to KBC pension scheme members for smooth elections that saw 94% voter turnout."

The Kenya Meteorological Department says that few parts of the country are expected to receive rainfall. In the weekly forecast the Weatherman says that “the counties of Murang’a, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Meru, parts of Kirinyaga and the northern part of Mandera are expected to receive heavy rainfall.” The Western, South Rift Valley and parts of the Coastal region are expected to receive moderate rainfall. According to the Director of Meteorological Service Dr. David Gikungu, average daytime temperatures of more than 30°Celsius will be experienced in the Coast, North-eastern and North-western Kenya as well as over isolated areas in the Highlands West of the Rift Valley and the South-eastern lowlands, as shown. Average night-time temperatures of less than 10°Celsius will be experienced in parts of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley, the Central Rift Valley and in the vicinity of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Climate Scientists at the Igad Climate Predictions and Applications Centers (ICPAC) in its weekly forecast indicates that more than usual rainfall expected in southern Tanzania, eastern Kenya, southern Somalia and western Ethiopia. “Moderate rainfall of between 50-200millimeters is expected in most parts of South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, southern and north-eastern Tanzania, southern and eastern Kenya, central to southern Somalia, and central to western Ethiopia,” says ICPAC in a statement and adds, “Light rainfall of less than 50 millimeters is expected over parts of central Tanzania, central to north-western Kenya, eastern Ethiopia, north-western Somalia, and parts of southern Sudan. According to the climate scientists, there is a likelihood of isolated flash flood over the flood prone areas in southern Kenya, southern Tanzania, south-western Somalia and western Ethiopia. They are further warning that elevated heat stress is expected on the cross-border regions of southern Sudan and northern South Sudan with high temperatures of over  32℃elsius expected in parts of southern Sudan. “Moderate to high temperatures of between 20-32℃elsius are expected over most parts Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania,” says the statement and adds, “Mild temperature conditions of less than 20℃elsius are expected over most parts of Burundi, Rwanda, central to western Kenya, and central Ethiopia.

ICJ to rule in UAE/Sudan genocide case on May 5,https://www.kbc.co.ke/icj-to-rule-in-uae-sudan-genocide-case-on-may-5/,2025-04-29T20:01:29+03:00,"Genocide,ICJ","The International Court of Justice said Tuesday it would issue its ruling in Sudan’s case against the United Arab Emirates on May 5. Khartoum has dragged the UAE before the ICJ, accusing it of complicity in genocide by backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) battling the Sudanese army since 2023. The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has dismissed Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end the war that has killed tens of thousands. Sudan wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war. Legal experts say Sudan’s case may founder on jurisdictional issues. When the UAE signed up to the Genocide Convention, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause enabling countries to drag each other before the ICJ over disputes. As robed lawyers wrestle over legal interpretations of jurisdiction in the panelled hall of the Peace Palace, the human cost of the conflict has continued to mount. Nearly 500 civilians have been confirmed killed in Sudan’s North Darfur in recent weeks, the United Nations said last week, condemning “horrifying” numbers of deaths and widespread sexual violence. The UN human rights office said it had listed at least 481 civilians killed in North Darfur since April 10 and that the “actual number is likely much higher”. The state has become a key battleground in the war that erupted on April 15, 2023 between the regular army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, headed by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The war has left tens of thousands dead and triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment."
Ex-senator Perdue confirmed as US ambassador to China,https://www.kbc.co.ke/ex-senator-perdue-confirmed-as-us-ambassador-to-china/,2025-04-29T19:54:08+03:00,"China,David Perdue","The US Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Donald Trump’s political ally David Perdue to be ambassador to China, a key trade partner that the Republican president has hit with punishing tariffs. Perdue, a 75-year-old multi-millionaire business executive, served as a Republican senator for Georgia from 2015 to 2021 — but failed in a bid for governor of the state in 2022. He is expected to play a key role in managing the relationship between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies. A Trump ally, he backed the former president’s false claims regarding alleged fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which the billionaire Republican lost to Joe Biden. A special grand jury had recommended indicting Perdue over those claims, but the district attorney ultimately declined to charge him in that case. Since taking office in January, Trump has ignited a trade war with China, imposing new tariffs totaling 145 percent, in addition to sector-specific levies on products such as electric cars. He hailed Perdue as a “loyal supporter” when he announced his pick, touting the entrepreneur’s business experience as making him well-suited for the diplomatic role in Beijing. While in the Senate, he served on the Armed Services Committee — chairing its Sea Power subcommittee — and on the Foreign Relations Committee. He was one of the richest members of Congress, and one of its most active traders on the stock market while in office. The New York Times reported in 2020 that the US Department of Justice had investigated him for possible insider trading. Prosecutors did not bring charges in that case."
Envoy says US should cease blackmailing China over tariffs,https://www.kbc.co.ke/envoy-says-us-should-cease-blackmailing-china-over-tariffs/,2025-04-29T19:38:59+03:00,,"Chinese Ambassador to Kenya, Guo Haiyan, has reiterated Beijing’s condemnation of what it describes as blackmail by the United States amid the ongoing trade war between the two nations. While addressing the press about President William Ruto’s recent state visit to China, the envoy stressed that China is willing to collaborate with other countries to address various challenges through solidarity and cooperation, safeguard legitimate rights and interests, uphold international trade rules, and maintain fairness and justice. This amplifies President Xi Jinping’s position that “there are no winners in tariff and trade wars.” “Recently, we’ve been hearing that the U.S. saying that China and the U.S. are having talks and even about to reach a deal. But in fact, none of that is true. China and the U.S. are not having any consultations or negotiation on tariffs, still less reaching a deal,” she stated. Ambassador Guo insisted that the current tariff war was initiated by the U.S., and that China’s position on the matter remains consistent and clear. She promised, “We will fight, if fight we must.” However, she indicated that China is prepared to engage the U.S. in discussions to find a lasting solution. “Our doors are open. If a negotiated solution is truly what the U.S. wants, it should stop exerting extreme pressure, stop threatening and blackmailing China, and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit,” she said."
Some reckless MPs planned to travel to Taiwan during Ruto’s visit to China – Mudavadi,https://www.kbc.co.ke/some-reckless-mps-planned-to-travel-to-taiwan-during-rutos-visit-to-china-mudavadi/,2025-04-29T18:59:57+03:00,,"Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has described as reckless and malicious an attempt by some MPs to travel to Taiwan during the period when President William Ruto was touring China. Mudavadi stated that the legislators’ plan to visit Taiwan was intended to undermine the government’s efforts to strengthen its relationship with China, which he deemed unpatriotic and provocative. Speaking during question time at the Senate, while appearing before the Senate Security and Foreign Affairs Committee, Mudavadi emphasized that such a move would have been provocative. “We know, there were some people who were pushing to have a delegation from Parliament to go to Taiwan when the President of Kenya is visiting China for a State visit. It could have cost the country a lot,” said Mudavadi. He noted that there are certain issues that the country and, particularly, elected leaders need to be aware of, as they can have serious and devastating implications for the broader welfare of the nation. During his trip to China, President Ruto declared that Kenya supports the One-China policy, a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, and dialogue to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He stated that during the state visit to China, Kenya secured benefits that could significantly alter the country’s economic situation, and that some were displeased with the government’s achievements. “There were some who did not want the government to achieve anything in the visit, today, once the agreed projects are in place we will have an SGR to the border of Uganda at the Malaba and a dual road to same destination, this will spare economic growth in the regions of Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western,” said Mudavadi. He urged parliamentarians to be patriotic and to conduct themselves in a way that sets a good example and influences the younger generation positively. On investments in Kenya’s foreign embassies, Mudavadi mentioned that Kenya is now engaging in a policy to explore how to develop its assets abroad, as outlined in the policy document being worked on by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with Parliament. “We want to use the exchequer, and where we can, also have public-private partnerships. I say so because if you go to Upper Hill today, and I was the guest of honor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tanzania came and we jointly broke ground where the pension fund, Tanzania pension fund, is putting up a 22-story building,” said the PCS. He explained that the building is for the Tanzanian embassy but will also serve as a revenue-generating asset for the Tanzanian government, allowing them to lease out the additional space they do not require. Mudavadi noted that similar initiatives have taken place in several countries. For example, Uganda has a prime building in New York, not far from the UN headquarters, as well as a significant building in Trafalgar Square in London, and Uganda House in Nairobi. “We have a plan to be able to start making serious investment proposals for the assets that we have so that we can maximize the returns and draw, which can then help in funding our missions, more robustly as we go into the future,” said Mudavadi."

World Animal Protection launches “Just Transition” campaign ahead of COP 30,https://www.kbc.co.ke/world-animal-protection-launches-just-transition-campaign-ahead-of-cop-30/,2025-04-29T20:28:06+03:00,,"World Animal Protection has officially launched a campaign advocating for a just transition away from industrial animal agriculture during a high-profile webinar event held earlier today. As part of the Road to Belém, the organization announced its active participation in the upcoming 30th Conference of the Parties (COP 30), where it will be calling for urgent action to reform global food systems in alignment with climate, biodiversity, and human rights goals. The new campaign presents a compelling case for phasing out industrial factory farming and transitioning to equitable, humane, and sustainable food systems. This move is essential to meeting international climate commitments, including the Paris Agreement, and safeguarding public health and planetary boundaries. Sally Kahiu, the External Affairs Lead at World Animal Protection Said, “Our global food system, especially industrial animal agriculture, not only accelerate biodiversity loss, deplete water resources, and contribute to rural poverty and public health crises but also compromise animal welfare on a massive scale. As we start our journey of mobilizing like-minded stakeholders, our rallying call is just one, we’re calling on world leaders in this year’s COP 30 to recognize the urgent need for a global food system that places people, animals, and the planet over profit. It’s about rebuilding food systems that are just, resilient, and climate safe.” Based on their previous research, World Animal Protection highlights that food system emissions alone could derail efforts to stay below the critical 1.5°C warming target—even if fossil fuel use is eliminated. It calls for a 50% reduction in global emissions from animal production by 2030, alongside a strong shift toward plant-rich diets and agroecological practices, especially in high-consuming and high-producing countries. The expansion of industrial animal agriculture has led to poor living conditions for billions of animals, increased risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks and the overuse of antibiotics, contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, the destruction of natural habitats for agricultural expansion for animal feed and production threatens wild animal populations, driving species to the brink of extinction and further destabilising ecosystems. World Animal Protection’s campaign emphasizes: World Animal Protection will continue to mobilize public support and collaborate with allies across civil society, Indigenous groups, youth, and sustainable farming networks in the lead-up to COP 30 in Belém, Brazil to advocate for a just transition away from industrial factory farming to an equitable, humane and sustainable food systems globally."

The PS was speaking when he made his inaugural visit to MTRH on Monday to assess service delivery and progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). He noted that the hospital treats over 1.5 million patients annually, performs more than 60,000 surgeries, and conducts over 2 million laboratory tests, positioning it among the most important health institutions in the country. Touring key facilities including the Radiotherapy Centre, Renal Centre, Catheterisation Laboratory (Cathlab), and specialized MRI services, Dr. Oluga praised the hospital’s efforts to expand access to advanced medical care within the region. He lauded MTRH’s partnerships with international institutions in North America and Europe, which continue to strengthen its clinical and research capacities. Dr. Oluga also highlighted the hospital’s successful integration of the Social Health Authority (SHA) model, which has improved insurance processing and patient access to care. Emphasizing the Ministry’s focus on strengthening healthcare delivery, Dr. Oluga called for enhanced collaboration between referral hospitals and county health facilities. He noted that reducing patient congestion at MTRH requires building capacity in county hospitals to manage non-critical cases locally. “There are three critical pillars in the health sector: restoring public trust, upholding integrity, and delivering quality services,” said Dr. Oluga. “Every health worker must understand their role in delivering efficient and dignified care.” The Principal Secretary was received by MTRH Chief Executive Officer Dr. Philip Kirwa, Board Members, and senior management. He was accompanied by Douglas Bosire, Acting CEO of the National Syndemic Diseases Control Council, and Agnes Tuiyot, representing the Chief Executive Officer of the Social Health Authority.

Kenya rejects Sudan’s SAF claims of involvement in ongoing conflict,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-rejects-sudans-saf-claims-of-involvement-in-ongoing-conflict/,2025-04-29T13:58:48+03:00,,"The Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs has dismissed claims made by Sudan’s SAF administration, shifting blame to Kenya for the tragic and ongoing conflict that has afflicted the country for over two years. In a statement, the Ministry described the allegations as unfounded and reiterated that Kenya is solely interested in a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Sudan. “While it is not in Kenya’s interest to engage in needless exchanges, especially on a matter so grievous and intractable, it is nonetheless incumbent to put the record straight and to urge people and nations of goodwill to disregard those tirades as baseless,” the Ministry stated. The Musalia Mudavadi-led Ministry explained that, contrary to the accusations, Kenya’s leadership has never taken sides in the situation in Sudan. “In an effort to find a negotiated settlement, Kenya has met leaders of the two main warring sides in Nairobi, both simultaneously and at separate intervals, in accordance with its unrivalled credentials for peaceful conflict mediation,” the Ministry stated. “Recently, some Sudanese nationals gathered in Nairobi to discuss issues affecting their country and adopted a roadmap. The convening of this dialogue forum in our capital, Nairobi, or elsewhere on Kenya’s territory, neither equates to endorsing any forum’s outcome nor constitutes the formation of an exile government as has been alleged,” the Ministry added. The Ministry insists that as long as the conflict remains unresolved, it will continue to concern the region and the world at large. Kenya will not remain passive and has therefore urged key players in the conflict in Sudan to seek a pathway to peaceful resolution and end the bloodletting."
Hewani Energy to invest Ksh 33B in Meru Wind-Solar Project,https://www.kbc.co.ke/hewani-energy-to-invest-ksh33b-in-meru-wind-solar-project/,2025-04-29T13:08:21+03:00,"BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA),Hewani Energy","Hewani Energy is investing USD 250 million (approximately Ksh 33 billion) in a landmark renewable energy project in Kandebene Sub-Location, Tigania West Constituency, Meru County. The Meru Wind-Solar Energy Project, set to be completed within three years, is expected to generate 220 megawatts of power, serving over 400,000 households. The project, which is part of the state BottomUp Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and universal electricity access to rural areas for economic growth, was among several major initiatives launched recently by President William Ruto during his development tour of the Mt. Kenya region. A few weeks after the launch, top national and county officials, investors and local residents visited the site to assess progress and sensitise the community on the project’s benefits. Tigania West Deputy County Commissioner Faith Murage said the government was committed to supporting green energy initiatives under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda. She emphasised that ongoing community sensitisation would ensure residents fully understand the project’s scope and long-term benefits. Meru County Investment and Development Corporation Director Winnie Mukiri stated that the county held a five per cent stake in the project, with the potential to scale up to 20 per cent. She added that legal teams had reviewed the agreements between Hewani Energy and landowners, confirming the project’s viability. According to Hewani Energy’s Economic Development Manager Victor Mutuerandu, the hybrid facility will harness 200 megawatts from wind turbines and 20 megawatts from solar photovoltaic systems spread across 100 acres. The energy will be stored in a 10 MWh battery and transmitted to the national grid via the Isiolo Sub-Station, located just 10 kilometres away. Mutuerandu revealed that 32 wind turbines will be installed, and the company already holds environmental approvals from both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. He noted that community involvement had been integral to the project, with over 1,800 option and license agreements signed with 2,000 local landowners. He added that the company supported the community in acquiring land ownership documents, which were issued around the time of the presidential visit. With proper documentation in place, Hewani Energy is set to enter into long-term leases of 20–30 years with the landowners, depending on the power purchase agreement secured. Mutuerandu stated that landowners hosting turbines will earn a minimum of Ksh 200,000 annually, while others will receive between Ksh 10,000 and Ksh 20,000 per acre per year. Additionally, 1.5 per cent of gross revenue from electricity sales will go to landowners and 0.5 per cent will be channelled into a community trust focusing on education, health, agriculture, and water projects. He clarified that the area designated for the project is uninhabited, free of settlements, graves, or shrines and home to no critically endangered species. Mutuerandu assured that robust grievance mechanisms were in place and that the company maintained an open-door policy for resolving community concerns. Speaking on behalf of residents, Julius Kaleria, a local landowner, said the project had accelerated access to land titles, a long-standing challenge for many in the area. The project is jointly owned by Seriti, a South African renewable energy firm with a 75 per cent stake, and Japan’s Eurus Energy, which holds the remaining 25 per cent. Since its inception in 2014, Hewani Energy has been active in developing wind and solar projects across East Africa."

The pact follows a three-day stakeholder forum convened by the Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC) under the Resilient Approaches in Natural Rangeland Ecosystems (RANGE) programme. The initiative brought together leaders, elders, morans, women, and youth from the region to chart a new path toward sustainable peace. Community representatives emphasised the need for collective responsibility to break the cycle of cattle rustling and revenge killings. They advocated for community policing, intelligence sharing, and collaboration with government agencies to identify and isolate criminal elements within their communities. Chari Ward MCA Mejja Golicha, and Samburu elder Joseph Lekalkuli raised concerns about a notorious hideout in “Lantana,” Samburu East, which they said harbours armed criminals from multiple counties. They urged security agencies to dismantle the hideout and monitor the return of young men posing as herders. Isiolo County Commissioner Geoffrey Omoding criticised police officers who retreat during raids involving armed bandits, arguing that such actions embolden criminals. He urged officers to request reinforcements, including aerial support, and revealed that the government had armoured vehicles and was prepared to use advanced weapons, including bombs, to neutralise armed threats. FCDC’s RANGE Programme Manager, Saiyana Lempara, expressed hope that with full involvement of all stakeholders, including morans, women, and minority groups, the peace initiative would succeed. He urged every community member to play an active role in securing lasting peace. Josephine Muli, a representative of the Turkana community in Ngaremara, called for stronger investment in education, saying schooling is the most effective way to prevent cattle rustling and other criminal behaviour. She encouraged mothers to engage more closely with their sons to deter them from joining criminal groups. The peace agreement was signed by representatives of the Borana, Samburu, Turkana and Rendille communities, as well as county and national government officials, with religious leaders present as witnesses."

The Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) announced the suspension on April 29, 2025, citing the growing concern over the proliferation of gambling activities and misleading advertising. In a statement, BCLB Chairperson Dr. Jane Mwikali Makau said the Board had noted an alarming trend where gambling promoters were portraying betting as a legitimate investment opportunity and a shortcut to wealth. She warned that such misrepresentations were having devastating social and economic impacts on individuals, families, and communities. Dr. Makau also expressed concern over the widespread airing of gambling advertisements during the watershed hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., saying this exposed minors to betting content and contributed to growing addiction cases. To address the issue, the BCLB ordered the immediate halt of all gambling-related advertisements and promotional content across all media platforms, including TV, radio, print, social media, billboards, SMS, email campaigns and influencer endorsements. During the suspension period, all licensed gambling operators have been instructed to submit their advertisements to the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) for vetting and classification in accordance with the Film and Stage Plays Act. The BCLB further directed operators to ensure full compliance with existing gambling laws and implement responsible gambling practices as part of their licensing conditions. In addition to the suspension, the government has established a Multi-Agency Enforcement Team tasked with creating strategic interventions and enforcing responsible gambling regulations. The team comprises representatives from key government bodies, including the Ministry of Interior, Office of the Attorney General, the Communications Authority of Kenya, Kenya Revenue Authority, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, KFCB, the Media Council of Kenya, Financial Reporting Centre, and the BCLB itself. The BCLB also urged Parliament to fast-track the Gambling Control Bill, which is expected to give regulators enhanced supervisory powers. It further called on the Media Council of Kenya to finalise new advertising guidelines, following a court ruling that nullified the previous programming code. Members of the public were encouraged to report any violations or suspicious gambling operations directly to the BCLB or the nearest police station for investigation. The Board emphasised its commitment to protecting the youth, promoting social responsibility, and restoring integrity in Kenya’s gambling sector."

Goat A.I innovation sparks agricultural transformation in Kirinyaga,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kirinyaga-farmers-reap-big-as-waigurus-goat-a-i-program-transforms-livelihoods/,2025-04-29T11:29:27+03:00,"Artificial insemination,Goat","Farmers in Kirinyaga County are reaping the benefits of a transformative goat Artificial Insemination (A.I) programme aimed at boosting goat productivity and farmers income. The program that is a collaboration between the County Government and the Goat A.I. Center domiciled at Kenya Animal Genetic Resources Center (KAGRIC) in Kutus, is a revolution that is yielding life-changing results for small-scale farmers across the county. The goat AI center was recently officially launched President William Ruto but many farmers in the county have already benefited from the resource through provision of subsidized hybrid goat semen and liquid nitrogen that cost the county government, Ksh. 354,000. Through the goat improvement program, the county government has also supported 600 goat farmers who are organized into 60 groups through which they have accessed goat kids, does and community bucks to improve breeding practices.  Governor Anne Waiguru has lauded the initiative as a game-changer for livestock farming and a major step towards security and the county’s economy. “We are particularly honored to host the Goat AI Centre at Ndomba, which is not only a great treasure for our County but also a key development milestone for our Country. This Center is a significant step forward in improving goat production and food security,” Waiguru said. Waiguru emphasized that the Centre will improve farmers’ access to high-quality breeds, enabling increased milk and meat production thereby uplifting household incomes and livelihoods. She also noted that trained A.I. inseminators are already deployed across the county, ensuring timely and effective services. The County Government has also been sensitizing farmers on the importance of AI and subsidizing the cost of services, making them more affordable compared to private sector rates. “With the right genetic improvements and more efficient farming practices, we can unlock the full potential of goat farming and provide a steady supply of quality products to meet expanding markets,” Waiguru said. Local farmers have already seen remarkable improvement as told by Peter Njoroge, a goat farmer from Mwea. He said that the improved breeds provided by the County Government have increased growth rates and milk production, supporting his family and boosting his income. “The new breed of goats are now growing faster and now I have a bigger herd and milk production has increased and so are my earnings.” Said Njoroge. He has nine goats with each producing about two liters of milk daily which he sells at Ksh. 170 per liter, a great improvement compared to less than one liter of milk produced by lower breeds of goats. His milk is collected by a Thika based company on a weekly basis. Another farmer, Robinson Karuri from Kithiriti, is keeping eight goats born out of the A.I. initiative “I am happy because I recently got goat kids of the Agro-Nubian breed, which are strong and produce a lot of milk. We use some at home and sell the rest,” Karuri said, noting that the subsidized A.I. from the county government has helped them a lot given that it could have cost them around Ksh. 5,000 to source insemination for one goat from the private providers. Governor Waiguru noted that goat products are in high demand from hospitals, hotels, and restaurants, presenting a lucrative opportunity for farmers. She noted that the initiative aims to equip farmers with technology, quality breeds, and skills to increase productivity thus transforming goat farming from traditional subsistence activity into a modern, profitable agribusiness, changing lives, one goat at a time. Unlike larger livestock such as cattle, goats are more affordable to raise and require less land and feed, making them ideal for small holder farmers. They also have a faster reproductive cycle, allowing for quicker herd expansion and faster returns on investment. From a climate resilience perspective, goats are hardier and more adaptable to dry conditions than cows, making them a smart choice for regions affected by climate change. Goat milk is also a lucrative produce commanding high prices in hospitals, hotels and health stores as it is packed with nutrients and is favorable to people with allergies as well as infants, the elderly and people with lactose intolerance."
Kajiado County launches campaign to eradicate invasive ipomoea weed,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kajiado-county-launches-campaign-to-eradicate-invasive-ipomoea-weed/,2025-04-29T08:24:21+03:00,"Governor Joseph ole Lenku,Ipomoea","Kajiado County has launched a community sensitisation campaign aimed at eradicating Ipomoea, an invasive weed that has choked grazing fields across the region. According to Michael Semera, the County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Environment, Natural Resources and Climate Change, the weed,  declared a county disaster last year by Governor Joseph Ole Lenku,  has taken over vast areas of grazing land, causing immense losses to livestock farmers as no pasture can grow beneath it. Speaking during the campaign launch in Matapato South, Semera stressed the urgent need to curb the spread of Ipomoea, warning that it threatens livelihoods by suppressing grass and other vegetation, rendering large tracts of land unproductive and unsuitable for livestock grazing. He noted that Ipomoea has spread widely in Matapato North, Matapato South, and Imaroro in Kajiado East, severely affecting livestock keepers who are now forced to relocate in search of pasture, despite recent rains in their areas. “The only solution is to uproot it, especially during the rainy season when it becomes easier to remove. We are calling upon all farmers to uproot it from their farms to protect the environment and save our livelihoods,” said Semera. As part of the campaign, the department has sensitised 10 community groups, each comprising 100 members, who will relay the information to the wider community. Semera added that under the World Bank-funded Financing Locally-Led Climate Action (FLLoCA) Program, the county is reintroducing high-quality pasture species to communities to help reverse the damage caused by the fast-spreading weed, locally known as Oltiameleteti. The CEC further revealed that the County Government has set aside 30 acres of land in Imaroro and Matapato to serve as demonstration sites. Here, community members, supported by technical officers, will lead efforts to clear Ipomoea and restore the land. During the sensitisation exercise, technical officers demonstrated how to identify, uproot, and safely dispose of the invasive plant. Grass seeds were also distributed to community groups to aid in regenerating cleared land with pasture, improving livestock production and soil health. Ipomoea was first detected in Kenya during the 1997 El Niño rains and has since spread to an estimated three million acres in Kajiado County alone."

Violence reportedly erupted from a land dispute, leading to a tragic escalation in which police clashed with local residents, resulting in fatalities. “I wish to extend a message of heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives today during the skirmishes that ensued in Ang’ata Barrikoi over a disagreement stemming from a land demarcation exercise,” he said in a statement. Murkomen stated that authorities are actively investigating the events that transpired. “I regret that the situation led to needless loss of lives and injuries both to the police and civilians. Investigations are ongoing to establish the number of deaths, the people responsible for the deaths and those who instigated the tension,” he added. He assured the locals that, despite their fears, no one in the area will lose their land, and he appealed to them to remain peaceful while the state moves in to address the matter conclusively. “To our citizens in that area, we want to assure them that no one under the watch of this administration will be able to take away an inch of their property, none. There is no need for them to take the law into their own hands. The government of Kenya exists to provide security for citizens and their property,” the CS assured. “Regarding the misguided propaganda that land was being taken away from the rightful owners unlawfully, I assure them that cannot happen under this administration,” he said. The Cabinet Secretary confirmed that security has been reinforced in the area and urged calm and restraint. “The government is committed to protecting the lives and property of every citizen, and no one can take away their property illegally,” he stated."
Terre des Hommes Netherlands launches ‘Also Online’ campaign to combat online sexual exploitation of children,https://www.kbc.co.ke/terre-des-hommes-netherlands-launches-also-online-campaign-to-combat-online-sexual-exploitation-of-children/,2025-04-29T00:59:13+03:00,,"Online grooming, sextortion, livestreaming, and child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) are examples of the exploitation children encounter in the digital environment (online) today. Recent research conducted with children and parents/caregivers by Terre des Hommes Netherlands revealed that socio-economic challenges, low digital literacy, and authoritative parenting impairs caregivers’ ability to protect their children from risks of online sexual exploitation. Child rights organisation Terre des Hommes Netherlands is launching the “Also Online” campaign to make parents/caregivers aware of how to protect their children better online. Online child sexual exploitation is a growing global crisis. According to Childlight (2024), over 300 million children have been victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse in the past year alone. In Kenya, over 46,000 reports of online child sexual abuse and exploitation were recorded in 2023 according to the 2023 Cybertipline (NCMEC). Findings from the Disrupting Harm report (2021) paint a troubling picture. 7% of children aged 12-17 had been offered money or gifts in return for sexual images or videos of themselves, while 3% had been threatened or blackmailed online to engage in sexual activities. 7% of children have had their sexual images shared with others without their permission. At the same time, the 2023 SCROL baseline study in Kenya shows that 60% of parents/caregivers have low levels of knowledge and attitudes related to online child sexual exploitation. Additionally, around 38.8% of children reported that their parents do not understand the internet and social media applications’ functionalities. This knowledge gap impedes parents and caregivers from providing effective assistance in shielding their children from online sexual exploitation and related risks. This concern was affirmed in the 2025 research “Understanding parents’ and caregivers’ role in preventing and responding to the Online Sexual Exploitation of Children” report that revealed a significant gap in knowledge and communication between children/young people and their parents/caregivers. The research showed that victims would rather report to their fellow peers or counsellors than their parents. This gap makes it difficult for parents/caregivers to protect or intervene in cases of OCSE. Many parents/caregivers remain unaware of what happens online, including if their children are sexually abused. For children, the shame and stigma of speaking up can be overwhelming, especially if they fear punishment or judgment from their parents. Despite the challenges, the report reveals that some caregivers in Kenya are finding ways to empower their children to be safe online, and it highlights the stories of these champions and powerful role models. Also Online To address the growing threat of online child sexual exploitation, Terre des Hommes Netherlands is launching the ‘Also online’ campaign. The campaign aims to create targeted awareness among parents and caregivers in Africa about the online world their children also live in. Through the Terre des Hommes Netherlands website, parents and caregivers can access practical tips and tools designed to help them engage in open, supportive and safe conversations with their children. As Magdalene Wanza, Kenya Country Director explains, ¨At the heart of our Also Online campaign are conversations. Conversations where parents and caregivers feel equipped to guide their children in identifying and responding to risks online. Through simple conversation starters such as ‘How was your day? Also Online’, ‘Do not talk to strangers. Also Online’ we aim to bridge the gap between the digital and real world—empowering parents and caregivers to protect and guide their children in both spaces.”"

Koskey stated that the President acted on the recommendations of the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC) in exercising the prerogative of power of mercy conferred upon the Head of State and Government by the Constitution. “In exercising this presidential authority that breathes life into the principles of rehabilitation and restorative justice, His Excellency the President has extended the hand of clemency to fifty-six Kenyan citizens and one foreign national, all of whom were serving long jail-term sentences in various prisons in our country,” said Koskey. He noted that Conditional Release was granted to thirty-one petitioners serving life sentences, while Conditional Release and Repatriation was granted to the foreign national, a citizen of an East African Community Partner State, who was also serving a life sentence. “Remission and Release was granted to twenty-five individuals, allowing for their discharge upon remission of the unexpired portion of their custodial sentences,” Koskey added. Additionally, the Head of Public Service confirmed that President Ruto extended General Amnesty to all petty offenders sentenced to six months or less, as well as to offenders serving sentences longer than six months whose remaining terms are now six months or less. “To strengthen the arc of justice, the Head of State and Government has urged all stakeholders within the criminal justice system to explore ways in which the principles of reconciliation, restoration, rehabilitation, and reintegration into the community can be more effectively expressed and implemented,” Koskey stated in the notification."

Mudavadi said that estimates for public engagement activities range between Ksh.10 million to Ksh.100 million per exercise, depending on the scale and geographical coverage. Speaking he met with high-level meeting with the United Nations Country Team led by Resident Coordinator Stephen Jackson, Mudavadi warned that the current cost model is unsustainable, noting that such financial demands could deprive vital sectors like health, education, and infrastructure of critical funding. “While public participation is a constitutional imperative, we must be honest about the cost implications. Resources must be used judiciously. We cannot justify spending hundreds of millions where those funds could instead be used to build hospitals or upgrade schools,” said Mudavadi. In the meeting to review key development milestones and discuss urgent governance reforms, Mudavadi revealed that the government is finalizing a Public Participation Bill, which will provide a structured legal framework for public involvement in decision-making processes. The meeting focused on the presentation of the UN Kenya 2024 Annual Results Report and discussions on Kenya’s evolving public participation framework Mudavadi stressed the need for innovative approaches, proposing the integration of technology to lower costs and broaden citizen access. “We must embrace digital platforms, virtual consultations, and other technology-driven models that make participation more efficient and impactful,” he said. Mudavadi pointed out that failure to conduct adequate public participation risks nullifying government legislation and programs, which could hinder the achievement of national priorities. “Public participation is not optional. If not properly conducted, laws and policies can be challenged and overturned. We must rationalize the process without compromising its spirit,” added Mudavadi. He urged the UN to support Kenya in developing affordable, scalable models for civic engagement that uphold constitutional principles while safeguarding public finances. On the broader diplomatic front, Mudavadi also celebrated the recent approval by Parliament of Kenya’s first Foreign Policy Sessional Paper, describing it as a historic achievement for the country. He said the endorsement provides Kenya with a coherent and predictable diplomatic framework that aligns foreign relations with national development objectives. “The adoption of our Foreign Policy Sessional Paper strengthens Kenya’s position on the global stage. It gives clarity to our engagements and aligns them with economic diplomacy, environmental protection, peace, and diaspora matters,” said Mudavadi. Presenting the report, Jackson outlined the UN’s contribution towards Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), citing progress in areas such as governance, healthcare, education, climate resilience, economic empowerment, and peacebuilding. Mudavadi welcomed the UN’s support, emphasizing the importance of strategic partnerships in realizing Kenya’s development goals. Jackson commended Kenya’s efforts in reinforcing democratic governance and inclusive development. He reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to supporting Kenya’s reforms and partnerships, including in strengthening public participation mechanisms. Jackson affirmed that citizen involvement is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for fostering government accountability and trust. “The United Nations stands ready to work with Kenya to ensure public participation is effective, inclusive, and sustainable,” he said. The 2024 UN Kenya Annual Results Report showcased how the UN’s joint efforts with Kenya have contributed to improved social protection systems, enhanced education outcomes, strengthened health services, accelerated climate adaptation programs and promoted human rights. The meeting concluded with a strong commitment from both sides to deepen cooperation in advancing governance reforms, economic empowerment, sustainable development, and Kenya’s global diplomatic standing."

New Testament Bible in Upper Pokomo Language Unveiled,https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-testament-bible-in-upper-pokomo-language-unveiled/,2025-04-28T15:51:59+03:00,"Bible Translation,Hola","The Bible Translation and Literacy (BTL) organization has officially launched the Upper Pokomo New Testament Bible in Hola Sub-County, Tana River County, Kenya. The translation project, which cost approximately Ksh 45 million and took ten years to complete, involved extensive linguistic surveys and the development of a standardized writing system (orthography). It required careful study to distinguish Upper Pokomo from the closely related Lower Pokomo language. Upper Pokomo is spoken in the upper reaches of the Tana River basin and, while similar to Swahili, remains distinct from other coastal Bantu languages like those of the Mijikenda. Founded in 1981, BTL is a Christian-based organization dedicated to facilitating Bible translation and literacy development among small language groups in Kenya and beyond. Speaking during the Bible dedication ceremony at the Africa Inland Church (AIC) Hola, BTL’s National Director, Rev. Peter Munguti, said the Upper Pokomo community is blessed to now have the scriptures in their native language — an opportunity many communities across East Africa are still awaiting. “I urge the Upper Pokomo people to read and understand the Word of God so that they may fully grasp His will,” said Rev. Munguti. He also called upon clergy to actively use the new translation in their ministry to help transform lives and encouraged the wider church community to support BTL’s mission to reach all communities with the Bible in their native languages. Rev. Munguti affirmed BTL’s commitment to completing the translation of the entire Bible into Upper Pokomo. BTL Board Chairperson Kendi Ogamba emphasized the significance of the new translation, saying it would empower Christians to personally understand the foundations of their faith rather than solely relying on religious leaders. “The Bible plays a crucial role in our lives, and we believe Upper Pokomo speakers will now be able to deepen their understanding of God’s Word,” said Mrs. Ogamba. She further highlighted the dangers of religious misinformation, citing the Shakahola tragedy as a consequence of believers being misled due to a lack of personal engagement with scripture. Mrs. Ogamba warned that the rise of false prophets could misguide future generations if access to the Bible in native languages is not prioritized. Bible translation is vital for bridging language and cultural barriers, enabling deeper personal connections with the scriptures. Currently, BTL is engaged in translation work across 37 languages in Kenya, six in Tanzania, and three in South Sudan. In Kenya’s coastal region, BTL has completed and dedicated full or partial Bible translations for the Duruma, Digo, Giryama, Lower Pokomo, and Chonyi languages."

Speaking during a tour at NYS Yatta Field Unit in Machakos County, the CS emphasized the pivotal role NYS plays in youth empowerment, national development, and job creation. He revealed that the expansion is part of a broader government strategy to harness the potential of the youth while addressing unemployment and enhancing service delivery across the country. In a bid to make NYS more self-reliant and productive, CS Ruku called for the commercialization of NYS activities. Particular focus will be placed on agriculture, with products such as avocados, maize, and beans earmarked for large-scale production and sale. He called on members of Parliament to accelerate the commercialization of selected government agencies in a bid to improve efficiency, generate revenue, and reduce the financial burden on the national budget. The appeal comes amid growing concerns over the rising cost of maintaining under performing or non-essential government institutions. During a recent parliamentary session, legislators across party lines emphasized the urgency of implementing long-standing recommendations to restructure and commercialize entities that have the potential to operate profitably. In a significant boost to Kenya’s environmental restoration initiatives, the CS announced that over 5,000 officers from the NYS will be enrolled to participate in the ongoing cleanup of Nairobi River. The move, he said, is part of the broader programme that aims at rehabilitating the city’s water bodies and providing employment opportunities for the youth. The CS lauded NYS officers for their dedication and patriotism and urged other civil servants to emulate them for effective service delivery in the country."

CS Duale noted that SHA provides comprehensive coverage for all Kenyans, a significant improvement over the now-defunct National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which was primarily designed for employed citizens. He stressed that the shift towards a more inclusive model is essential to ensure every Kenyan can access affordable healthcare services, regardless of their employment status. He also criticized opponents of the SHA reforms, describing them as cartels who previously exploited loopholes within the NHIF for fraudulent gains."
GALVmed launches new effort to boost ruminant vaccination in Africa,https://www.kbc.co.ke/galvmed-unveils-programme-to-boost-ruminant-vaccination-in-africa/,2025-04-28T10:50:03+03:00,"Ruminant vaccines,Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods","The Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed) Monday announced a new 5-year programme to address the near-universally poor rates of ruminant (cattle, sheep and goats) vaccine coverage across Africa. Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods 2 (VITAL 2) is a follow-on project to the flagship VITAL initiative that supported the development and commercialisation of quality, safe and effective vaccines for livestock. VITAL 2 will continue to build the portfolio of available ruminant vaccines and focus on raising the low vaccination rates of small and large ruminants across sub-Saharan Africa, using private sector-driven initiatives to transform the market for high-quality vaccines and to complement governments’ vaccination plans . This will in turn unlock the enormous and much-needed development potential of livestock for small-scale producers. Across the African continent, livestock are one of the leading sources of food security and resilient livelihoods. Livestock production contributes between 30-80% of the continent’s total agricultural GDP and provides jobs and nutrition for millions. Yet, Africa’s livestock sector faces several growing challenges, not least the spread of harmful diseases, which disrupt the incomes and livelihoods of rural communities. In total, some 20% of the world’s livestock is estimated to be lost to disease, with the burden exceptionally higher in regions like sub-Saharan Africa. In most cases, vaccines often represent the single most effective livestock disease prevention tool to mitigate the effects of these challenges, helping to safeguard the income, livelihoods and food supply that livestock provide. In sub-Saharan Africa, the problem of low ruminant vaccination persists affecting mostly small-scale livestock producers (SSPs). VITAL 2 seeks to catalyse a transformation across the entire African ruminant vaccine market, focusing on exemplar areas and production systems within Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria to attain rapid, significant results. It is expected that this will drive ongoing growth and expansion of private sector delivered ruminant vaccination in other countries beyond 2030 through relevant stakeholder groups. VITAL 2 will focus on three strands of complementary work which include; enabling the Vaccine Environment which will develop the necessary vaccine market linkages across the numerous stakeholder groups to enable private sector ruminant vaccine enterprises to become established as a key contributor to the government’s livestock development plans and then rapidly expand. Similarly, delivering Private Sector Driven Vaccine Supply Chains to create access to ruminant vaccines through upstream (working with vaccine manufacturer to provide efficient supply of vaccines to the retailers) and downstream (working with other stakeholders to strengthen veterinary service provision and awareness creation among SSPs on the inherent value of vaccinating ruminants). As well as progressing Product Development for Ruminant Vaccines to continue the development of novel multivalent ruminant vaccines for widespread use by SSPs. Speaking during the announcement, Dr Carolin Schumacher, GALVmed’s CEO, said: “In recent years, together with our partners JOVAC, Hester Biosciences, M.C.I. Santé Animale and MSD Animal Health, we have succeeded in developing and bringing to market a portfolio of affordable ruminant vaccines and medicines for the neglected small-scale livestock producer customer segment of the global south. In VITAL 2, we would like expand the ruminant vaccines market to adequately address the needs of the continent’s tens of millions of small-scale producers and to enable them to make vital contributions to food security and economic growth on the continent, including their own.” Dr Schumacher added: “We will work closely with authorities, veterinary professionals, value chain partners and livestock farmers to identify the best way forward to improve livestock health and productivity through prevention of diseases.” It is expected that through VITAL 2, millions of SSP customers will be served with a portfolio of ruminant vaccines and other essential animal health products."
Kajiado: Herders raise concern over Ipomea weed,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kajiado-herders-raise-concern-over-ipomea-weed/,2025-04-28T10:39:55+03:00,"Ipomea Weed,Kajiado County","Herders in Kajiado County are a worried rot following the widespread invasive Ipomea weed affecting pastoralism. In recent years, the invasive Ipomea weed has diminished the little pasture causing panic among herders. Regular periods of drought has worsened the situation. Herders say the weed is not only destroying their pastures but also forcing men to travel long distances in search of pasture for their animals.
To them, the trend is unsustainable, and the survival of their pastoral way of life hangs in the balance. During the weed uprooting exercise in Maili Tisa funded by the County Government herders were sensitized on the importance of protecting their graze land against the weed. They were encouraged to uproot and burn the weed before reseeding their range lands for livestock rearing sustainability. The County officials further urged the herders to embrace alternative animal feeding to avert animal death during the dry seasons. In 2023 the County Government declared Ipomea a County disaster that is said to have affected at least 2Million acres so far."

This call was made by the CEO of the Commission for higher Education (CEO), Prof. Mike Kuria, during a tree planting exercise held at Zetech University’s Mangu Campus. Prof. Kuria emphasized the critical role higher education institutions play in combating climate change, urging them to inspire the wider community by taking visible steps in environmental conservation. “Universities should be at the forefront in addressing climate change. Students must become active participants in the fight against global warming,” he said. He encouraged students to plant tree species that support their institutions’ technical and research missions. Additionally, he revealed that the Commission is collaborating with the Kenya Forest Service to ensure universities have access to quality seedlings, as part of a nationwide effort to make learning institutions more tree-friendly and climate-conscious. Zetech University Vice Chancellor, Prof. Njenga Munene, echoed Prof. Kuria’s sentiments, highlighting the university’s commitment to environmental responsibility. “Zetech has already established a tree nursery and is cultivating seedlings that contribute to climate resilience,” he said. “We are not just producing graduates; we are nurturing change-makers dedicated to creating a better environment.” Prof. Munene reaffirmed the university’s pledge to integrate sustainability into its operations and curriculum, positioning Zetech as a model for green practices in higher education. He said the event marked a significant step in promoting climate consciousness within the academic community, with Zetech University setting an example for other institutions across the country."
Suspect charged with murder in Canada car attack that killed 11,https://www.kbc.co.ke/suspect-charged-with-murder-in-canada-car-attack-that-killed-11/,2025-04-28T08:18:58+03:00,"Canada,Filipino","The suspect in a Canadian car-ramming attack that left 11 dead at a Filipino street party was charged with murder, police said Sunday, adding that additional charges were anticipated. The suspect, identified as Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, of Vancouver, was charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, according to the Vancouver Police Department. Lo, who appeared in court before returning to police custody, was alleged to have acted deliberately and had a history of mental health problems, police said. No motive has been confirmed for the Saturday evening attack in the western city of Vancouver, though terrorism was ruled out by police. The ramming shocked the country a day before a general election dominated by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canadian products and his threat to annex his northern neighbor, long a key ally and trading partner. Police chief Steve Rai said the 30-year-old suspect drove a black Audi SUV and had a “significant history” of interaction with police and mental health care professionals. The Filipino community had gathered in Vancouver’s Sunset on Fraser neighborhood when festivalgoers were hit by the SUV. The celebration called the Lapu Lapu Festival commemorates a Filipino anti-colonial leader from the 16th century. Prime Minister Mark Carney, in a brief address to the nation, teared up as he addressed the tragedy. Carney later visited Vancouver on Sunday, arriving with flowers in hand to attend a church vigil held in honor of the victims of the attack, according to the CPAC broadcaster. “Last night families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son, or a daughter,” he said. “Those families are living every family’s nightmare.” An AFP reporter saw police officers at the scene Saturday evening, with parts of the festival venue cordoned off. Footage posted online and verified by AFP shows the vehicle with a damaged hood parked on a street littered with debris, meters from first aid crews tending to people lying on the ground. Eyewitness Dale Selipe told the Vancouver Sun that she saw injured children on the street after the vehicle rammed into the crowd. “There was a lady with her eyes staring up, one of her legs was already broken. One person was holding her hand trying to comfort her,” Selipe told the newspaper. – ‘Bodies everywhere’ –
Festival security guard Jen Idaba-Castaneto told a local news site that she saw bodies everywhere. “You don’t know who to help, here or there,” she said. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said in an X post: “I am shocked by the horrific news emerging from Vancouver’s Lapu Lapu Day Festival tonight.” Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said in a statement he was “completely shattered to hear about the terrible incident.” In Canada’s capital Ottawa, Julie Dunbar, a semi-retiree out for a morning run, recalled an attack in 2018 in Toronto in which a man in a van killed 11 people. “So it has occurred before, but I fear for the society that we live in, that these things can happen,” said Dunbar, 72. Saturday’s event featured a parade, a film screening, dancing and a concert, with two members of the Black Eyed Peas featured on the lineup published by the organizers. Lapu Lapu Day is celebrated in the Philippines in remembrance of Indigenous chief Lapulapu, who led his men to defeat Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521. “This is the darkest day in our city’s history,” Vancouver police said in a statement. Britain’s King Charles III, Canada’s head of state, said on Sunday he was “profoundly saddened” by the deaths. Canadians go to the polls Monday after an election race where candidates have wooed voters on issues including rising living costs and standing up to Trump. Carney is favored to win after assuring voters he can stand up to Washington’s barrage of sweeping tariffs and threats of annexation."
"Nobel laureates urge Trump, Putin to meet on denuclearisation",https://www.kbc.co.ke/nobel-laureates-urge-trump-putin-to-meet-on-denuclearisation/,2025-04-28T08:04:21+03:00,"Atomic Bomb,JAPAN","Three Nobel Peace Prize-winning groups campaigning to eliminate nuclear weapons joined forces on Monday to urge the US and Russian presidents to meet and agree on significant denuclearisation. The joint appeal came from Japan’s atomic bomb survivors’ group Nihon Hidankyo, which won last year’s Nobel; 2017 laureate the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN); and the 1985 winner, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. They sent a joint letter to the two leaders, ICAN said in a statement Monday. “At this moment of extreme nuclear danger, we call on you to take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions and to engage in meaningful negotiations for nuclear disarmament,” they wrote to US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The two countries between them control 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. The groups said they were prompted to write their letter following Trump’s suggestion after returning to power in January that he wanted the world to “denuclearise”, and the Kremlin’s expressed openness to the idea. “The current climate surrounding nuclear weapons is the most volatile in decades,” they said, warning of potential “catastrophic consequences for all humankind”. The Nobel laureates called in their letter on the two leaders to follow the example set by their predecessors Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. The then US and Soviet leaders met in Iceland in 1986 during the Cold War and agreed the deepest cuts ever in their countries’ nuclear forces. “The expansion of nuclear weapons capabilities is not a route to safety,” the groups argued. “It only increases the risk these weapons will be used by accident or design. “The only viable security strategy is one that moves the world away from the brink of nuclear catastrophe and prioritises disarmament,” they added. “Nuclear weapons are not an inevitable force of nature that must be endured,” they said. “They were built by human hands, and they can be dismantled by human hands. All that’s required is political will.”"
She maybe the Princess of Africa but Yvonne has the heart of a Queen,https://www.kbc.co.ke/she-maybe-the-princess-of-africa-but-yvonne-has-the-heart-of-a-queen/,2025-04-28T08:07:23+03:00,,"Musician, humanitarian, and entrepreneur Yvonne Chaka Chaka recently turned 60. The popular musician says she has no plans to stop singing and spreading love and goodwill. Chaka Chaka has been at the forefront of South African popular music for almost four decades and is popular throughout Africa in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Gabon, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. She still performs across the continent. Born Ntombizodwa Moloko Machaka on March 18, Yvonne Chaka Chaka is proud of her Dobsonville, Soweto roots. To celebrate her milestone birthday, she teamed up with a national retail chain to spread the love, distributing 100 grocery hampers to Soweto residents. She plans to take the initiative to the country’s townships and Africa. When interviewed at her home in Bryanston, Chaka Chaka kindly made her mom’s famous cheese and tomato toast, chatting over a meal and wonderful coffee. She said she and her two sisters came from humble beginnings. They were the daughters of a domestic worker who had high hopes for her children. “My mother worked hard as a domestic worker. She used to say, ‘I want you girls to be better than me – empowered and doing things for yourself’.” Growing up in the height of apartheid was not the end for her. “Growing up in Soweto, you think this is my boundary. You can never go anywhere. You are a non-entity in the system. You were born here; you live here and die here.” But not so, for Chaka Chaka. As a young black girl, apartheid dictated that she becomes a teacher or nurse, as that “was open to us, but becoming a doctor was higher grade.” She recalls that she was fortunate to have teachers she admired at school. “There was a teacher who was pretty and dressed up in skirts and jerseys. “I want to be like that. In 1976, I was 11 (at the time of the Soweto uprising against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction at schools), so my mother took me to Pretoria, where the protests were slightly less (hectic).” At school, Mr Mahlangu taught her accounting class. “He would tell us what a cash book, ledger, and journal were. When I returned to Johannesburg, I wanted to study accounting to become an accountant, but my mother wanted me to become a lawyer.” She went to the Department of Education, where she met a school inspector, as she needed to be placed at a new school. After telling him she wanted to become an accountant, he said, “That is wishful thinking. Your mother is a domestic worker, and your father is a gambler. This is not right. He broke my heart, dashing everything I aspired to be as an accountant.” He should have said, “Your mother and father are not educated, so it is good that you want to follow a career. This was rubbing salt in a wound, and I was broken. He told me to do housecraft just like my mother.” Chaka Chaka matriculated from Letarie High School, where her housecraft teacher was strict but a mother to the whole school. We were lucky to have teachers who were parents, social workers, and all-arounders to us. I wish we could go back there.” Her Afrikaans teacher “taught us to love the language as it is good to be good in someone’s language as they will respect you, even though we saw it as the language of the oppressor”. For Chaka Chaka, while apartheid was bad, “it taught us to care for one another. We were a close-knit community. Parents were parents to every child. Our teachers wanted us to be better than they were.” The apartheid system tried to ensure that the black child was happy with the little they had. “The intention was to make us stagnant.” In Dobsonville, there was a sense of community. “We didn’t see anything wrong with asking the neighbours for sugar or milk.  We were there for each other, and I miss that.” She acquired qualifications from Unisa and Trinity College while entering the music scene and earning the name “Princess of Africa.” Chaka Chaka questions whether those in strategic positions are “brave enough to give others a seat at the table. Sometimes, we become so happy to be the only one in the boardroom. When you are in, take the lead and bring others with you. It’s okay to be the first but not the only one.” “Look at (activists) Biko, Sobukwe, Mandela and Sisulu. They were great people. You cannot dictate to people what they should become. I believe in black power. You cannot put a good man down. There is a lot we can learn from those who came before us. We need to shape the future and give people a seat at the table.” She is doing just that, having been an ambassador for UNICEF and groups such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB, and , the Roll Back Malaria initiative, and the vaccine alliance Gavi. She laments that while colonisation was the worst sanction, Africa has natural resources to rise above poverty and challenges.  “God decided to give us beautiful weather and resources. (But) A man will always be greedy.”  For Chaka Chaka, “We need African leaders who take the best interests of the people they lead to heart and not say it’s time to eat and they take and take.” Critical of politicians, she says if they are sick, they won’t go to a public hospital or clinics, “as they do not believe in the system. They should be the first ones to go to the clinic. Neither do politicians send their children to public schools,” she adds. What makes her angry about politicians is that the ones who scream the most get in even if they don’t understand policies. “In Ghana, if you are not a lawyer, you cannot become a politician, as you need to understand policies there.” She sadly sees more young people pursuing self-gratification than serving fellow man. “I want my Maserati; I want my Porsche. Me, me, me. You don’t have to be a billionaire to do good. You can become wealthy and be an empty vessel.” Concerned that many young people did not vote in South Africa’s elections last year, she said, “You have the right to your opinion, but ask yourself what change you want. Go out and make the change. You don’t want to see this country going back to apartheid.” The popular musician is known for her humanitarian work and recently performed in Botswana. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Chaka Chaka is on a campaign to distribute 100 food parcels to underprivileged communities in each province through 2026. “Sixty years, plus 40 years in the creative industry,” she smiles. “There are so many people who don’t have anything. People are not happy being poor. Nobody wants society to feel pity for them.” As part of her celebration, she invited several legendary musicians to perform at a party she hosted on 5 April at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. It was a joyous celebration. As part of her plan to spread the love, she approached Wendy Lucas-Bull, Chairperson of Shoprite Holdings, for 100 food parcels recently distributed to families in Dobsonville. She also intends to do this in countries like Swaziland and is looking for sponsors. “I am celebrating my birthday with a purpose,” she said, adding that she will die happy, as she managed to do what she wanted. “You did not finish your fruit,” she admonished the writer, before concluding the interview with a hug, and pledging to support conversations towards a better country – and Africa."

Prof. Kindiki said the administration is not competing with the clergy on how they should treat senior government officials and politicians within their premises. Speaking on Sunday during a Church service at Marani Catholic Parish in Kitutu Chache North Constituency, Kisii County, the Deputy President said religious institutions play a key role in nation’s socio-economic growth. “As a Government, we respect the church. We are not in any competition with the church. The government is not in any competition with any religious faith,” DP said. The Deputy President reiterated that the church is a key pillar and partner in transforming the lives of the people. “We are not at loggerheads with the church. The government sees the church as a complementary institution supporting the welfare of the people.  We see the church as a valuable partner in what we are doing,” added Prof. Kindiki. The DP said churches enjoy the freedom to choose how they relate with politicians. “We will work with all those who invite us and respect the decisions of those who have said they don’t want our support. We will not announce our contributions if we are required not to do so,” DP stated. At the same time, he said all roads, including those in Kisii County, that stalled because the economy was not doing well have been revived and construction works are ongoing. “We have stabilised the economy, and right now we are reviving roads that stalled, including in Kisii,” he affirmed. Modern markets are also under construction in the county, including two in Marani and Kibugi in Kitutu Chache North Constituency. “We are building many markets across the country as we promised mama mboga and small-scale traders. They will have safer places to work in and will avert dangers associated with roadside trading,”he said."

Speaking during the official closing of the 11th Annual Scientific Conference of KNNA in Kisumu, Dr. Ouma Oluga, Principal Secretary for Medical Services, lauded KNNA’s achievements over the past decade, including the establishment of county hemodialysis units and life-saving Arterial Venous Fistula (AVF) surgical camps. “Since its inception, KNNA has maintained a strong collaborative relationship with the Kenya Renal Association (KRA) on matters pertaining to nephrology practice in Kenya. This partnership has yielded significant benefits. Notably, prior to this conference, KNNA, in conjunction with JOOTRH, successfully concluded a 3-day Arterial Venous Fistula (AVF) camp at JOOTRH.” He noted. The event was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Health, representatives from JOOTRH, the Kenya Renal Association (KRA), county governments, the University of Nairobi, Kenyatta National Hospital, and partners from the pharmaceutical sector. Dr. Oluga highlighted the recent AVF surgical camp at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, where 54 patients were screened and 15 underwent successful surgeries. “During this camp, 54 patients underwent screening. On the first day of surgery, ten patients benefited from successful procedures, with an additional 20 scheduled for surgery. While some patients were unsuitable due to medical reasons or required more complex procedures such as arteriovenous grafts, I am pleased to report that 15 patients received this crucial and affordable surgery.” The PS remarked. He noted that since 2016, over 400 patients have benefited nationally from the AVF initiative, made possible through collaborations with local and international partners, including National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Taiwan. “This AVF initiative, launched in 2016 through a partnership between KNNA, Kenyatta National Hospital, the University of Nairobi, and National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, has had a profound impact. To date, over 400 patients have benefited from surgery at Kenyatta National Hospital and various county hospitals in Nyeri, Meru, Isiolo, Narok, Nakuru, Bomet, and Laikipia Counties.” Dr. Oluga added. He also congratulated KNNA on its crystal jubilee and commended the organization’s sustained partnership with the Kenya Renal Association in advancing nephrology practice. Further, Dr. Oluga celebrated the recent elevation of JOOTRH to National parastatal status, promising that the Ministry of Health would work closely with national and county governments to ensure a smooth transition and continued improvement in healthcare services for the region. “I also note with satisfaction the elevation of JOOTRH to a National parastatal. The Ministry of Health is committed to ensuring a smooth transition to this new status.” He added.   Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/government-backs-fast-tracking-of-cancer-centre-completion-at-jootrh/"
"State committed to quality public service, says CS Ruku",https://www.kbc.co.ke/state-committed-to-quality-public-service-says-cs-ruku/,2025-04-27T18:37:14+03:00,Public Service CS Geoffrey Ruku,"Public Service Cabinet Secretary Geoffrey Ruku has reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to delivering quality services to Kenyans through enhanced public sector efficiency and citizen engagement. Speaking during a service at Matira-ini AIPCA Church in Konyu Ward, Mathira Constituency, Nyeri County, CS Ruku emphasized that the Kenya Kwanza administration values public feedback, adding that his ministry will continue engaging citizens directly to gather firsthand information. “The Government takes feedback from Kenyans seriously, which is why we hold public participation in high regard,” Ruku said. “You will see me moving around the country to hear directly from the people.” He noted that feedback on the Social Health Insurance scheme has been largely positive, indicating that initial challenges have been addressed. “The system is now effective and efficient. Every Kenyan should take the responsibility to register. Parliament has even allocated funds to cover emergency and chronic illnesses,” he stated. CS Ruku reiterated his Ministry’s resolve to collaborate with all government departments and ministries to realize the principles outlined in Article 232 of the Constitution, which guides the values and standards of public service. “Efficient resource use is a key constitutional mandate. For example, in the coffee sector, mismanagement and high-interest loans have in the past negatively affected farmers. These issues have now been addressed and farmers are reaping benefits,” he said. He also highlighted improvements in government-owned enterprises, noting that Kenya Airways has begun making profits after years of losses. He called on the nearly one million public servants in Kenya to adhere to the constitutional principles of resource efficiency and accountability. “We will spotlight any institution that fails to align with Article 232,” CS Ruku warned. Calling for cooperation with religious institutions, he urged the Church to continue offering spiritual guidance and prayers for National leaders. On infrastructure, the CS said that the government is fast-tracking the revival of previously stalled projects, particularly roads in the region. Accompanying the CS, Mathira MP Eric Wamumbi lauded the government’s ongoing development projects, stating that they are a sign of progress. “The Kenya Kwanza government is delivering. Many stalled projects are now back on track, and I will remain in Government to ensure our region gets its fair share. By 2027, we will have tangible results to show,” said Wamumbi. Meanwhile, Archdeacon Cleopas Mwangi urged for political tolerance, calling on both leaders and citizens to maintain mutual respect."
MPs raise alarm over rising insecurity in Kisumu amid market closure,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mps-raise-alarm-over-rising-insecurity-in-kisumu-amid-market-closure/,2025-04-27T18:27:17+03:00,"Insecurity,Kisumu County","A House Committee has expressed concern over the influx of insecurity cases in Kisumu County. The Members who met the Regional Police Commander of Kisumu Police Divisional Headquarters and Station Gisiri Nyamohanga Members of the  Committee on Administration and Internal Security heard that the main challenges her office handles include illegal mining activities in Nyanza, assault cases, murders, and incidents of mine collapses leading to fatalities. The County Commissioner of Kisumu Benson Leparmorijo, informed the Members that the closure of Kibuye Market has also contributed significantly to insecurity in the region. He clarified that the management of the market falls under the County Government of Kisumu. “I have held engagements with the Governor of Kisumu regarding this issue. I have also talked to the City Manager, who said that the place is not clean enough to be in operation,” said Leparmorijo. It was noted during the session that the closure of the market, which previously hosted over 5,000 traders, has forced many to sell their produce on the town streets, further escalating security concerns. Kisumu West MP Rozah Buyu expressed concern that political interference was partly fueling the market’s continued closure. “It is for us leaders to talk and agree to maintain peace. The violence noted is fueled by political leaders, especially during funerals and rallies. The gangs are operating in broad daylight, and it is an issue we urgently need to address,” she said. Nyakach MP Owuor Aduma (echoed similar concerns, lamenting the rise of criminal gangs not only in Kisumu, but also in his area. He emphasized that the growing insecurity must be tackled decisively. Also present at the meeting was the Deputy County Commissioner of Kisumu Wilberforce, who highlighted the urgent need to return police officers to official housing. “We want the police to live in police houses so that they can promptly respond during distress calls,” Wilberforce stated. He further outlined several challenges, including the need for enhanced police training and the impact of flooding -which has forced officers in Ahero and Muhoroni to live in rented houses, the need for renovation of police housing and a critical shortage of officers. The delegation chairperson Lari MP Mburu Kahangara acknowledged the concerns, explaining that budgetary constraints had paralyzed police recruitment over the past three years. However, he assured that plans are underway to recruit 10,000 police officers in the next financial year. He further directed the Committee Secretariat to note the issues raised, assuring that they will be addressed. “The issue of Ahero and Muhoroni will be escalated. The Inspector General is also particularly passionate about the issue of training. The Committee will deliberate on it,” said Kahangara. In his closing remarks, the County Commissioner appealed to the Committee to allocate Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIEs) to the newly gazetted units and provide vehicles to police stations to ease mobility. The same sentiments were echoed by Gisiri, who emphasized that the police would work more effectively once adequate resources are made available. The Committee also inspected the ongoing construction of the Kisumu West Sub-County Police Headquarters, a project championed by the area MP Rozah Buyu. According to the project manager, construction began in 2019, is currently 80pc complete, and the facility is scheduled to be opened by May 15, 2025."

The former minister had served in the position for only 27 days after being appointed by President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on March 22. According to NBC, Hengari was arrested on Saturday along with another person. “Police Inspector General Lieutenant General Joseph Shikongo said Hengari would face formal charges during the course of Sunday and was expected to appear in court on Monday,” the NBC reported Shikongo did not specify the reasons for the arrest but confirmed that Hengari was under investigation for 11 charges, including kidnapping, rape and assault, it added. NBC said that Hengari was arrested after he allegedly attempted to bribe a victim to withdraw a case involving accusations of repeated sexual contact with a minor between 2019 and September 2024. Shikongo said the events leading to the arrest left the police with “no option” but to take the former minister into custody. He also confirmed that the individual arrested alongside Hengari is related to the victim. Hengari’s resignation adds to a small number of cases in Namibia where ministers have stepped down following arrests. In 2019, former ministers Sacky Shanghala and Bernhard Esau resigned after being implicated in a major corruption scandal known as the “Fishrot” case, which involved allegations of bribery and money laundering in the fishing industry."

The 41-year-old Centre Party candidate was elected as Appenzell Innerrhoden’s first female Landammann, equivalent to mayor, the Keystone-ATS news agency reported. Her win, against three other candidates, made her the first woman ever elected Landammann in the canton, where women were only granted the right to vote 34 years ago. As every year on the last Sunday in April, the vote for regional and local leaders and judges took place at Appenzell Innerrhoden’s Landsgemeindeplatz — not by casting ballots but by way of raised hands. The tradition of the Landsgemeinde, or open-air assembly, dates back to the 14th century. But women have only been permitted to take part since 1991 — a full 20 years after women were permitted to vote in Swiss federal elections. And women might still be standing on the outside had Bern not found the situation so embarrassing that it made the almost unheard of move of ordering Appenzeller men to let their mothers, wives and daughters into the voting ring."
Iranian President Pezeshkian visits site of port blast that killed 28,https://www.kbc.co.ke/iranian-president-pezeshkian-visits-site-of-port-blast-that-killed-28/,2025-04-27T17:48:26+03:00,"Bandar Abbas,iran","Iran’s president visited on Sunday the scene of a massive port blast that killed 28 people and injured more than 1,000, as fires still blazed more than 24 hours after the explosion. The blast occurred on Saturday at Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of world oil output passes. With choking smoke and air pollution spreading throughout the area, all schools and offices in Bandar Abbas, the nearby capital of Hormozgan province, were ordered closed on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said. The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks. Arriving in Bandar Abbas, President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed his appreciation to first responders, adding “we have come to see first-hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on”. “We will try to take care of the families who lost their loved ones, and we will definitely take care of the dear people who got injured,” he said. Pezeshkian had previously ordered an investigation into the cause of the blast. Russia’s embassy said Moscow was sending multiple “aircraft carrying specialists” to help fight the blaze. According to Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, one of the aircraft is a dedicated firefighting plane. The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. Defence ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik later told state TV that “there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area”. The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. – Area sealed off –
A regional emergency official said several containers had exploded. Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand, in a video shared on the government’s official website, gave an updated toll on Sunday of 28 people killed and more than 1,000 injured. The ISNA news agency, citing the provincial judiciary, gave a higher toll of 1,242 injured and also put the number of dead at 28. Koolivand said some of the injured were airlifted for treatment in the capital Tehran. Thick black smoke was still visible in live footage from the scene aired by state TV on Sunday. “The fire is under control but still not out,” a state TV correspondent reported from the scene. The explosion was felt and heard about 50 kilometres away, Fars news agency reported. Also at the scene on Sunday, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said “the situation has stabilised in the main areas” of the port, and workers had resumed loading containers and customs clearance. Another official on site, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadegh, said only one zone of the port was impacted, and cargo “operations are still continuing as normal in the several other zones”. An image from Iran’s Tasnim news agency on Sunday showed a helicopter flying through a sky blackened by smoke to drop water on the disaster-struck area. Others showed firefighters working among toppled and blackened cargo containers, and carrying out the body of a victim. The authorities have closed off the roads leading to the site, and footage from the area has been limited to Iranian media outlets. – Mourning –
Beijing’s foreign ministry said in a statement to AFP on Sunday that three Chinese victims were in a “stable” condition. The United Arab Emirates expressed “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences, as did Pakistan, India, Turkey and the United Nations as well as Russia. The Tehran-backed Lebanese movement Hezbollah also offered condolences, saying Iran, with its “faith and solid will, can overcome this tragic accident”. In the first reaction from a major European country, the German embassy in Tehran said on Instagram: “Bandar Abbas we grieve with you.” Authorities declared a day of national mourning on Monday, and three days of mourning in Hormozgan province from Sunday. The explosion ripped through the port as Iranian and US delegations were meeting in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress afterwards. While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel."

Murkomen vows to tame land grabbers in Machakos,https://www.kbc.co.ke/murkomen-vows-to-tame-land-grabbers-in-machakos/,2025-04-27T16:34:18+03:00,"Interior CS Kipchumba Murkomen,Machakos County","Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has vowed to deal firmly with land fraudsters and land grabbers in Machakos who have become the biggest threat to security. The CS was speaking at the County Commissioners residence in Machakos during his end of Lower Eastern Jukwa la Usalama tour, where he met with National Government Administrative Officers (NGAO) and opinion leaders from every sub county in Machakos where the major issue raised was land grabbing. He said land grabbing has brought about insecurity issues and invasion by squatters and disclosed plans to find out which government officials and politicians are colluding with criminals in land fraud by using fake title deeds and harassing legal land owners. “Land is the biggest threat to Security,” declared Murkomen. Murkomen also disclosed plans to work with the land ministry in developing concrete policies and strategies that will tame land grabbers and fraudsters in Machakos once and for all as soon as they conclude the Lower Eastern tour of Jukwaa la Usalama. “We will compile a report that will inform the development of a National policy to address land ownership disputes, especially cases involving large tracts of land which have been invaded by squatters and land grabbers,” added the CS. He added that Machakos being close to Nairobi has made it a safe haven for criminals who have run away from Nairobi and has promised land owners to have proactive conversations with them on how best to help them secure their properties. Another key issue that came up during the deliberations with the NGAO, religious leaders, People with Disability (PWD) and members of the public is the Human wildlife conflict especially in Masinga Sub County where they requested a KWS office to bring services close to the people. They also decried on the increase of second generation alcohol, gambling machines that are destabilizing the youths in Machakos and urged for government intervention on curbing the vice. Machakos Governor Wavinya Ndeti reiterated the land issues in Machakos as the main challenge facing them with prominent officials having court orders to harass land owners who have legal title deeds. “Nobody has the right to invade private property where landowners have valid title deeds. We have seen fraudsters obtaining court orders to drive away genuine land owners using the police and we must finish this problem for good,” declared the Governor. She called upon the National government in fast tracking the issuance of 50,000 title deeds that are still in the lands office in Machakos to help in empowering residents. Principal Secretary for Interior Raymond Omolo on his part added that the importance of the Jukwaa la Usalama forum is to instill collaboration and unity between wananchi and security personnel in the counties while involving wananchi and ensuring they have a say. On second generation alcohol destroying the youths, Omolo said they are working with NACADA in launching a curriculum that will open up space for rehabilitation and also work with community leaders and churches in integrating them into the society. The Jukwaa la Usalama had several leaders such as Lower Eastern Regional Commissioner Paul Rotich, Machakos County Commissioner, Josephine Ouko, Machakos Deputy Governor Francis Mwangangi, County Assembly Speaker, Ann Kiusya among other County and National government officials."

Director of Occupational Safety and Health Services, Dr Andrew Muruka, says by harnessing technology, the country is not only going to increase production but minimize disasters that have been witnessed recently in the mechanized, construction and agricultural sectors. “We have noted that AI and digitization are critical in the most hazardous sectors of the economy and this includes construction, heavy machinery, manufacturing and agriculture sectors. These are the areas that require artificial intelligence so that we relieve the human workers’ burden associated with hazards in their line of work,” said Dr. Muruka. Muruka was speaking in Nanyuki, Laikipia County ahead of celebrations of his year’s World Day for Safety and Health on Monday April 28 under the theme: “Revolutionizing Health and Safety; The Role of AI and Digitization at Work. Muruka said the National Occupational Safety and Health under the Ministry of Labour was keen on aligning the safety digital solution with the Work Injury Benefits Act of 2007 and any amendments to ensure legal compliance and strategic consistency. “We would urge stakeholders including government, private sector and academia to deploy and ensure that they develop infrastructure for implementing AI and digitization for the safety of workers in the country,” pointed out Dr. Muruka. This year’s celebration will be the 20th one in the country and to mark the day, the organizers which also involve the private sector have come with what has been dubbed as Nanyuki 20 Declaration containing 13 recommendations geared towards making the workplaces safe. “Nanyuki 20 declaration is focusing and harnessing expertise in various sectors to safely use artificial intelligence and digitization to make our workplaces safe and all the implementations of such infrastructure are in compliance with the data protection act,” he said. Among the declaration was a call to the government to prioritize funding for mental health at the workplace even in the advent of digitization, advancing research, innovation and data driven for occupational safety and health, strengthening occupational and safety health capacity and digital literacy and public-private partnership. Laikipia County Commissioner, Onesmus Kyatha, reiterated the need for capacity building among the government workers on administering first aid as a move to reduce occupational hazards in the workplaces. “Most people have forgotten the basics on how to administer first aid which is very crucial. Government workers and Kenyans need capacity building aimed at addressing incidents when they happen at the homestead or even work places,” said the CC. In the past one week, several activities have been held including training of workers in both informal and informal sector on occupational safety and process of seeking compensation in cases injuries arising at work places Various organizations drawn from across the country participated in First Aid competitions while hundreds of local residents also benefited from a free medical camp organized by the Ministry of Labour, Laikipia County Government in partnership with Safaricom Foundation. Meanwhile, the World Day for Safety and Health National event will be commemorated in Nanyuki on Monday where Cabinet Secretary for Labour and Social Protection Dr. Afred Mutua will be the chief guest.

Association of Betting in Kenya announces new regulations ,https://www.kbc.co.ke/association-of-betting-in-kenya-announces-new-regulations/,2025-04-27T15:55:06+03:00,,"The Association of Gaming Operators in the country (AGOK) in partnership with government agencies, regulators, and civil society are spearheading a set of proactive initiatives designed to shape the future of the gaming industry and protect innocent Kenyans from addiction to gaming. In a press release, the Association says nationwide awareness campaigns promoting informed, mindful participation in gaming will be carried out across the country. Advocacy for tools such as time-out mechanisms, betting and deposit limits will be put in place to ensure a healthy and controlled gaming behaviour among Kenyans. “The gaming industry in Kenya continues to evolve rapidly, creating opportunities for economic growth, digital innovation, and employment. However, with this growth comes a heightened responsibility to safeguard the welfare of players, particularly young people and vulnerable populations,” the statement by AGOK’s board reads in part. “AGOK acknowledges the complex challenges associated with gaming, particularly around mental health, addiction prevention, and ethical standards. These are global concerns which members of AGOK take seriously. They are at the forefront of our agenda.” The Association furthers contends that all its members operate under a “shared code of conduct” rooted in principles of fairness, transparency, and social responsibility. Among meaningful steps it says it has taken to prevent exploitation and minimize harm include putting into place advanced age-verification systems to block underage access, self exclusion tools that provide options for and permanent restrictions to gaming activities, and round-the clock toll free helplines that offer confidential mental health and addiction support. The regulatory measures comes amid calls to regulate the sector following increase in cases of mental health and some suicide cases attributed to betting."
Ksh 6.8B coffee debt waiver on track as farmers benefit from reforms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/ksh-6-8b-coffee-debt-waiver-on-track-as-farmers-benefit-from-reforms/,2025-04-27T11:13:16+03:00,REFORMS,"The verification of debts owed to coffee cooperative societies is underway to ensure only legitimate claims benefit from the Government’s Ksh 6.8 billion debt waiver programme. This initiative is a key part of broader reforms that are revitalising Kenya’s coffee sector and delivering on the Government’s commitment to farmers. In line with the Agriculture Sector reforms outlined in the Kenya Kwanza manifesto, the Government’s interventions are beginning to bear fruit. This coffee season, farmers are celebrating record cherry prices, with rates climbing to between Ksh 120 and Ksh 148 per kilogram,  the highest in 35 years. To safeguard and build on these gains, the Government is streamlining the fertiliser subsidy programme for coffee farmers, subsidising pesticides, and accelerating the distribution of coffee seedlings. A major infrastructure modernisation plan is also underway, aimed at upgrading processing methods across the country. Additionally, new Acts of Parliament to regulate the coffee and cooperative sectors are in the final stages and are expected to be enacted and assented to within the next two months. These legislative changes are designed to entrench transparency, protect farmers’ earnings, and strengthen cooperatives. A critical milestone has been the dismantling of cartels that for decades manipulated milling, brokerage, and marketing operations. Freed from exploitative middlemen, Kenya’s coffee is now being aggressively marketed internationally, opening up new markets for farmers. This momentum was evident during a major consultative forum held in Embu County, where over 5,000 coffee farmers and leaders from 24 cooperative societies gathered. Key leaders, including Cabinet Secretary for Public Service and Human Development Geoffrey Ruku, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire, Senator Alexander Mundigi, Woman Representative Njoki wa Njeru, Runyenjes MP Eric Muchangi, Mbeere South MP Norbert Muriuki and Speaker Josiah Thiriku, among others, attended the meeting. The Government remains steadfast in implementing transformative reforms that empower coffee farmers, boost incomes, and restore Kenya’s place as a global coffee powerhouse."
All eyes turn to conclave after Pope Francis’s funeral,https://www.kbc.co.ke/all-eyes-turn-to-conclave-after-pope-franciss-funeral/,2025-04-27T10:56:28+03:00,"Conclave,Holy See","With Pope Francis laid to rest, all eyes turn now to the conclave, the secretive meeting of cardinals set to convene within days to elect a new head of the Catholic Church. Alongside world leaders and reigning monarchs, an estimated 400,000 people turned out on Saturday for the Argentine pontiff’s funeral at the Vatican and burial in Rome. The crowds were a testament to the popularity of Francis, an energetic reformer who championed the poorest and most vulnerable. Many of those mourning the late pope, who died on Monday aged 88, expressed anxiety about who would succeed him. “He ended up transforming the Church into something more normal, more human,” said Romina Cacciatore, 48, an Argentinian translator living in Italy. “I’m worried about what’s coming.” On Monday morning, at 9:00 am (0700 GMT), cardinals will hold their fifth general meeting since the pope’s death, at which they are expected to pick a date for the conclave. Held behind locked doors in the frescoed Sistine Chapel, the election of a pope has been a subject of public fascination for centuries. Cardinal-electors will cast four votes per day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority, a result broadcast to the waiting world by burning papers that emit white smoke. Luxembourg Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich said last week he expected the conclave to take place on May 5 or 6 — shortly after the nine days of papal mourning, which ends on May 4. German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told reporters on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”. – Left his mark –
Francis’s funeral was held in St Peter’s Square in bright spring sunshine, a mix of solemn ceremony and an outpouring of emotion for the Church’s first Latin American pope. More crowds gathered on Sunday for the opening for public viewing of his simple marble tomb at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, his favourite church in Rome. Francis was buried in an alcove of the church, becoming the first pope in more than a century to be interred outside the Vatican. “It was very emotional” to see his tomb, said 49-year-old Peruvian Tatiana Alva, who wiped away tears after joining hundreds of others filing past the burial place. “He was very kind, humble. He used language young people could understand. I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.” A couple of hours after opening, the large basilica was packed, the crowds periodically shushed over speakers. Among the mourners were pilgrims and Catholic youth groups who had planned to attend the Sunday canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which was postponed after Francis died. Raphael De Mas Latrie, 45, from France, had been bringing his nine-year-old son to the canonisation but they attended the funeral instead, saying they “really appreciated” Francis’s defence of the environment. “Today in this material world his message made a lot of sense, particularly to young people,” he said. He added that Francis’s successor did not have to be his likeness, for “every pope has a message for the world today”. In his homily at the funeral, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re highlighted the Jesuit pope’s defence of migrants, relentless calls for peace and belief that the Church was a “home for all”. “I hope we get another pope as skilled as Francis at speaking to people’s hearts, at being close to every person, no matter who they are,” 53-year-old Maria Simoni from Rome said. Many of the mourners expressed hope that the next pope would follow Francis’s example, at a time of widespread global conflict and growing hard-right populism. Marx said the debate over the next pope was open, adding: “It’s not a question of being conservative or progressive… The new pope must have a universal vision.” – Pray for ourselves –
More than 220 of the Church’s 252 cardinals were at Saturday’s funeral. They will gather again on Sunday afternoon at Santa Maria Maggiore to pay their respects at Francis’s tomb. There will also be a mass at St Peter’s Basilica at 10:30 am (0830 GMT) on Sunday, led by Pietro Parolin, who was secretary of state under Francis and is a front-runner to become the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 are eligible to vote in the conclave. There are 135 currently eligible — most of whom Francis appointed himself. But experts caution against assuming they will choose someone like him. Francis, a former archbishop of Buenos Aires who loved being among his flock, was a very different character to his predecessor Benedict XVI, a German theologian better suited to books than kissing babies. Benedict in turn was a marked change from his Polish predecessor, the charismatic, athletic and hugely popular John Paul II. Francis’s changes triggered anger among many conservative Catholics and many of them are hoping the next pope will turn the focus back to doctrine. Some cardinals have admitted the weight of the responsibility that faces them in choosing a new head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. “We feel very small,” Hollerich said last week. “We have to make decisions for the whole Church, so we really need to pray for ourselves.”"
NCIC to deal firmly with leaders fueling tensions,https://www.kbc.co.ke/ncic-to-deal-firmly-with-leaders-fueling-tensions/,2025-04-27T10:49:27+03:00,"National Assembly,NCIC","The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) and the Kenya National Assembly have vowed to take stringent measures against any leader found culpable of exacerbating tensions between farmers and pastoralists, asserting that no one is above the law. This commitment comes amid reports that influential government figures from Northern Kenya with substantial cattle holdings are interfering with peace efforts in Magarini Sub County, where thousands of livestock have migrated in search of water and pasture. During a community dialogue at a Malindi hotel, local leaders revealed alarming accounts of pastoralists employing uneducated juvenile herders armed with crude weapons, who they claimed were intimidating and attacking residents when their animals encroach onto farms. Mandera West Member of Parliament Yusuf Adan Yusuf, who chairs the National Assembly Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunities, emphasised the need for all leaders to foster peace and cohesion among communities and that those found to undermine such efforts would be taken head on. “No leader is above the law. Should we identify a leader involved in this issue, we will address the problem head on,” he said. “The law is for everybody. If the implementation of the law is the problem, we shall ensure that it is enforced as stated. If the law is faulty, we will amend it, because it is not like a religious book that cannot be edited.” He explained that the National Cohesion and Integration Commission Amendment Bill 2023 had already gone through the second reading in the August House and that when enacted, it will give more ‘teeth’ to the commission to enable it to discharge its mandate more effectively. Dr Danvas Makori, a commissioner with the NCIC, reflected on the longstanding nature of these conflicts, which he attributed to competition over vital resources such as water and pasture, adding that the commission had convened the dialogue meeting to listen to the residents of Magarini and pursue lasting solutions. “Our Constitution guarantees the right to live peacefully anywhere in the country, and we are here to implement effective strategies to address the root causes of these conflicts. We are deeply saddened by the loss of human lives and livestock, and we refuse to accept this as the norm,” he said. NCIC Chief Executive Officer Dr Daniel Mutegi Giti reaffirmed the commission’s commitment to national harmony, citing Article 40 of the 2010 Constitution, which guarantees the peaceful coexistence of Kenyans regardless of where they live. “We are determined to ensure that all communities in Magarini, Kilifi and throughout the country live in peace and cohesion. We will collaborate with other government agencies, including the National Land Commission and the Ministry of Land and Housing, to address historical grievances, though we acknowledge that such matters will require time and careful deliberation.” Magarini division Assistant County Commissioner Joshua Lentoi, said the local security committee had set up dedicated grazing zones where pastoralists can tend their animals without intruding on farmlands. Lentoi also called on the government to supplement relief food distributions with pasture seeds, which would help stabilise the designated zones. Farmers and pastoralists who talked to journalists called on the government to excavate watering points for animals as well as provide pasture so that the animals will not have to cross to farmlands. The farmers complained of harassment from the herders while the pastoralists complained that their animals were being killed, maimed or stolen."
China seizes disputed reef near key Philippine military outpost,https://www.kbc.co.ke/china-seizes-disputed-reef-near-key-philippine-military-outpost/,2025-04-27T10:13:26+03:00,"China,Manila","The Chinese coast guard has seized control of a disputed reef near a major Philippine military outpost in the South China Sea, according to Beijing’s state media, adding to longstanding territorial tensions with Manila. Beijing claims sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea and has waved away competing assertions from other regional countries as well as an international ruling that its position has no legal basis. China and the Philippines have engaged in months of confrontations in the contested waters, and Manila is currently taking part in sweeping joint military drills with the United States that Beijing has slammed as destabilising. The Chinese coast guard “implemented maritime control” over the Tiexian Reef, also known as Sandy Cay, during the middle of April, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Saturday. The tiny sandbank, part of the Spratly Islands, lies near Thitu Island, also called Pag-asa and the site of a Philippine military facility. CCTV said the coast guard landed on Sandy Cay to “exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction” over the reef, carry out an “inspection” and “collect video evidence regarding the illegal activities of the Philippine side”. The broadcaster published a photograph of five black-clad people standing on the uninhabited reef as a dark inflatable boat bobbed in the nearby water. Another shot showed four coast guard officials posing with a national flag on the reef’s white surface, in what CCTV described as a “vow of sovereignty”. The group also “cleaned up leftover plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris and garbage on the reef”, the broadcaster said. The Financial Times reported an unnamed Philippine maritime official as saying that the Chinese coast guard had left after unfurling the flag. There do not appear to be any signs that China has permanently occupied the reef or has built a structure on it. In recent months, Beijing and Manila have blamed each other for causing what they describe as the ecological degradation of several disputed landforms in the South China Sea. China’s state news agency Xinhua on Friday cited a report from the natural resources ministry that it said “debunked” Manila’s allegations that Beijing’s land reclamation projects had harmed the local environment. Philippine forces are present on Thitu Island and Manila inaugurated a coast guard monitoring base there in 2023 in an effort to counter what it describes as Chinese aggression. On Monday, the Philippine and US militaries launched three weeks of annual joint exercises called “Balikatan”, or “shoulder to shoulder”, which will include an integrated air and missile defence simulation for the first time. US Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn said at the opening ceremony in Manila that the two side would “demonstrate not just our will to uphold our mutual defence treaty in existence since 1951 but our matchless capability to do so”. “Nothing builds bonds more quickly than shared adversity,” he said, without specifying a common threat. Beijing said the manoeuvres “undermine regional strategic stability” and accused Manila of “collusion with countries outside the region”."
Xinhua News Agency opens branch in Guinea-Bissau,https://www.kbc.co.ke/xinhua-news-agency-opens-branch-in-guinea-bissau/,2025-04-27T10:05:46+03:00,"China,Guinea-Bissau","China’s Xinhua News Agency inaugurated its Bissau branch on Friday, with the approval of the government of Guinea-Bissau. At the unveiling ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau Yang Renhuo said that during the state visit of President Umaro Sissoco Embalo to China last July, Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Embalo reached an important consensus on deepening cultural and people-to-people exchanges and media cooperation between the two countries, providing strategic guidance for bilateral cooperation in the field of journalism. As China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua took the lead in establishing a branch in Bissau, which is a major measure to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, the ambassador said. This move marks a milestone in promoting cultural and people-to-people exchanges, enhancing mutual trust, and deepening traditional friendship between China and Guinea-Bissau, he said. Florentino Fernando Dias, Guinea-Bissau’s minister of social communication, said that the country maintains a “positive and open attitude” toward strengthening cooperation with Chinese media, including Xinhua, and welcomes the establishment of a Xinhua branch in Bissau. Ying Qiang, director of Xinhua’s Africa Regional Bureau, expressed hope that the Bissau branch will do a good job reporting on Guinea-Bissau’s social development, people’s lives, and the fruits of China-Guinea-Bissau cooperation to help the African country’s voice reach more audiences in China and around the world. Xinhua will take this as an opportunity to take root in Guinea-Bissau and radiate across West Africa, tell more real, vivid and warm stories, and contribute media power to deepening the friendship between China and Guinea-Bissau as well as that between China and Africa, Ying said. The Bissau branch is the 184th overseas branch established by Xinhua News Agency."
Several killed as driver plows into Vancouver festival crowd,https://www.kbc.co.ke/several-killed-as-driver-plows-into-vancouver-festival-crowd/,2025-04-27T10:06:47+03:00,"Canada,Lapu Lapu Day","Several people were killed after a driver plowed into a crowd at a street festival on Saturday in the Canadian city of Vancouver, local police said. “A number of people have been killed and multiple others are injured,” Vancouver Police posted on X. “The driver is in custody.” The incident happened as members of the Filipino community gathered to celebrate Lapu Lapu Day, Vancouver mayor Ken Sim posted on X. The festival, which commemorates a Filipino anti-colonial leader from the 16th century, falls this year on the weekend before Canada’s election. “Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time,” Sim wrote. Police said the incident happened shortly after 8:00 pm Saturday (0300 GMT Sunday) in the city’s Sunset on Fraser neighborhood. Photos published by Canadian broadcaster CBC showed emergency crews at the scene as well as large crowds at the block party earlier Saturday. Festival security guard Jen Idaba-Castaneto told local news site Vancouver Is Awesome that she saw “bodies everywhere.” “You don’t know who to help, here or there. It’s so shocking,” she said. British Columbia Premier David Eby said he was “shocked & heartbroken” by the news in a post on X. – Election season –
Saturday’s event featured a parade, a film screening, dancing and a concert, with two members of the Black Eyed Peas featured on the lineup published by the organizers. “Our thoughts are with the victims and their families — and Vancouver’s Filipino community,” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party said on X. Lapu Lapu Day is celebrated in the Philippines in remembrance of indigenous chief Lapulapu, who led his men to defeat Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521. The deadly incident comes a year after Canadian Nathaniel Veltman was sentenced to life in prison for running down a Muslim family with his truck on the street in London, Ontario in 2021. The ruling in Veltman’s case was the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case. Canadians go to the polls Monday after an frenetic election race where candidates have wooed voters on issues including US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and rising living costs. Prime Minister Mark Carney is favored to win after assuring voters he can stand up to Washington’s barrage of sweeping tariffs. His Liberal Party trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points in most polls on January 6, the day former prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his plans to resign."
India and Pakistan troops exchange fire in Kashmir,https://www.kbc.co.ke/india-and-pakistan-troops-exchange-fire-in-kashmir/,2025-04-27T10:06:37+03:00,"INDIA,Kashmir","Troops from Pakistan and India exchanged fire in disputed Kashmir for a third night in a row, officials said Sunday, as relations between the nuclear-armed rivals plunged to their lowest level in years. India has accused Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir for a quarter of a century. Islamabad has denied any involvement, calling attempts to link Pakistan to the attack “frivolous” and vowed to respond to any Indian action. Indian security forces have launched a giant manhunt for those responsible for killing 26 men at a tourist hotspot in Pahalgam on April 22, with police naming two Pakistani nationals among the fugitive gunmen. The Indian army said on Sunday there had been “unprovoked” firing of small arms “initiated by Pakistan” along the Line of Control (LOC) that separates the two countries. “(Our) own troops responded effectively with appropriate small arms fire,” it added. Pakistan has not yet confirmed the latest exchange of fire. In the aftermath of the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced the closure of the main land border crossing with Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis. In response, Islamabad has ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers, cancelling visas for Indian nationals — with the exception of Sikh pilgrims — and closing the main border crossing from its side. The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”."
"Toll rises to 25 dead, 800 wounded in Iran port blast",https://www.kbc.co.ke/toll-rises-to-18-dead-800-wounded-in-iran-port-blast/,2025-04-27T10:07:01+03:00,"Bandar Abbas,iran","The blast occurred Saturday at Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, near the Strait of Hormuz through which a fifth of world oil output passes. The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. Iranian state TV on Sunday gave an updated toll of 18 people killed and 800 injured, with thick black smoke still visible in live footage from the scene. Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate. The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50 kilometres (30 miles) away, Fars news agency reported.     Images from IRNA showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris after the blast at Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000 kilometres south of Tehran. Flames engulfed a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car, while a helicopter dropped water on massive black smoke clouds billowing from behind stacked shipping containers. Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that “hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres”, while the provincial blood transfusion centre issued a call for donations. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”. Speaking later at the scene, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni told state TV: “All resources from other cities and Tehran have been dispatched.” With choking smoke and air pollution spreading throughout the area, all schools and offices in Bandar Abbas, the nearby capital of Hormozgan province, have been ordered closed on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said.     Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of the province’s crisis management authority, told state TV that “the cause of this incident was the explosion of several containers stored in the Shahid Rajaee Port wharf area”. “The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported. Saturday is the start of the working week in Iran, meaning the port would have been busy with employees. The United Arab Emirates expressed “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences. The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that the explosion “has no connection” to its facilities and that “Bandar Abbas oil facilities are currently operating without interruption”. The explosion comes several months after one of Iran’s deadliest work accidents in years. The coal mine blast in September, caused by a gas leak, killed more than 50 people at Tabas in the east of the country. Saturday’s explosion also came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress. pdm/rjm/ami © Agence France-Presse"

Government moves to strengthen JOOTRH services ahead of national corporation transition,https://www.kbc.co.ke/government-backs-fast-tracking-of-cancer-centre-completion-at-jootrh/,2025-04-27T09:34:12+03:00,JOOTRH,"The government has underscored the urgent need to fast-track the completion of the Cancer Centre at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) to reduce the burden of patient referrals for radiotherapy services to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). The Principal Secretary for the State Department for Medical Services, Dr. Ouma Oluga assured the leadership of JOOTRH that government will prioritize introducing radiotherapy and cardiology services, the two critical specialities currently missing at the facility. The PS was speaking during a visit to JOOTRH following earlier assessments by the Kenya Medical Practitioners Council (KMPC) and the Kenya Health Professionals Oversight Authority (KHPOA), which classified JOOTRH as a Level 6A facility. Dr. Oluga’s visit focused on evaluating service delivery, staffing, infrastructure, equipment, and financial obligations to ensure a smooth transition.  Similarly, the PS announced plans to expand maternal and child health services, bolster neonatal care, and enhance the hospital’s capacity for training and research. While acknowledging the challenges posed by the regional disease burden and the withdrawal of USAID funding, he pledging that the government would bridge any emerging funding gaps. Further he noted that JOOTRH will benefit from the Social Health Authority (SHA) structured financing model, which is projected to support up to 90% of the hospital’s revenue. The transition process is grounded in Article 187 of the Kenyan Constitution (2010) and is expected to be fully implemented by 30th June 2025. Dr. Richard Lesiyampe, JOOTRH’s Chief Executive Officer, expressed the hospital’s readiness for the shift, highlighting the urgent need for additional nursing staff and the establishment of new specialized services. Kisumu County’s CECM for Health and Sanitation, Dr. Gregory Ganda, welcomed the move, terming it the realization of a long-term vision for healthcare transformation in the region. The Principal Secretary was received by Dr. Ganda, Acting Board Chair Festus Achilla, and members of the hospital’s executive committee. JOOTRH will now embark on a 14-day public participation process ahead of the issuance of the legal notice that will formalize this historic milestone."
"Parliamentarians unite for immunization financing in Africa, Asia",https://www.kbc.co.ke/parliamentarians-unite-for-immunization-financing-in-africa-asia/,2025-04-26T22:56:00+03:00,,"In the heart of Istanbul, a powerful alliance emerged last week as 21 Members of Parliament (MPs) from across Africa and Asia gathered with a shared mission: to champion sustainable immunization financing in their countries. The two-day forum, organized by the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI) with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, marked a watershed moment in parliamentary advocacy for public health. Parliamentarians hold a unique position in the machinery of government. As elected representatives, they serve as both the voice of their constituents and as critical oversight bodies for executive actions. Their ability to influence policy, allocate budgets and hold governments accountable makes them indispensable allies in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases – diseases that continue to claim far too many young lives. “We’ve witnessed a powerful convergence: 21 parliamentary leaders have come together to issue a landmark call to action,” noted Vandana Shah, Vice President of Health Systems Strengthening at GHAI. “They are demanding their governments prioritize domestic immunization funding to reach every  child, eliminate the tragedy of zero-dose children, and safeguard both public health and global security.” Building a Parliamentary Movement The forum, held April 15-16, 2025, brought together parliamentary champions from Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Liberia, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Zambia. These weren’t just any parliamentarians – they were carefully selected health advocates, with 16 serving on health committees (nine as chairs), two chairing existing Parliamentary Immunization Caucuses, and others holding key positions in finance and national immunization advisory groups. The objectives were clear: foster collaboration, share effective strategies, develop actionable plans and establish a parliamentary network dedicated to increasing political will and domestic resources for sustainable immunization financing. With many countries navigating Gavi transitions and the Alliance’s crucial 2026-2030 replenishment on the horizon, the timing couldn’t have been more critical. Landmark Outcomes The forum culminated in the adoption of the Istanbul Parliamentary Call to Action for Immunization Financing – a bold declaration that outlines specific commitments and appeals to multiple stakeholders. In this powerful statement, the parliamentarians called upon their governments to: The Call to Action also urged international partners and donors to continue robust investment in immunization, including supporting Gavi’s ambitious goal to raise $9 billion for its 2026-2030 period. These funds are vital to protect 500 million more children, enable responses to 150 disease outbreaks, and support the introduction of new life-saving vaccines. Most significantly, the parliamentarians constituted themselves into an Africa-Asia Parliamentary Network. This dedicated body aims to amplify advocacy for increased domestic health budgets, strengthen parliamentary oversight of immunization programs and facilitate the sharing of best practices across continents.  From Words to Action The impact of the forum was immediate. Even before leaving Istanbul, country delegations developed specific action plans. The MPs from Madagascar held a press conference at the airport upon their return, declaring their intention to develop a parliamentary caucus on immunization financing. Similar commitments emerged from Liberia for caucus formation, while Laos and Ghana pledged to create multi-stakeholder coalitions. Prof. Mayfong Mayxay from the Laos National Assembly was upbeat about his plan to collaborate with civil society organizations CSOs within the country on advocacy and funding efforts. “We will also discuss how we can set up a Vaccine Trust Fund to fill the gaps — especially the 2025 funding gap of about 700,000 US dollars — which the government will need to contribute as part of the co-financing with Gavi,” he said. Hon. Dabah N Varpilah, Chair of Liberia’s Senate Committee on Health, expressed strong commitment: “I will convene a committee meeting to brief my colleagues… 100 percent support to being able to domestically raise resources to finance vaccines and a lot of primary health issues.” For Hon. Christopher Kang’ombe, Chair of the Committee on Health at the National Assembly of Zambia, the imperative was clear: “How do we ensure that children grow into adults? We obviously have to safeguard their growth, and one way… is obviously ensuring that they are vaccinated to prevent diseases.” The forum also reinforced the critical partnership between parliamentarians and CSOs. As Hamzah Mangal Zekrya, Senior Manager of Strategic Partnership at Gavi, observed, their relationship is like “two sides of the same coin,” recognizing that CSOs often voice perspectives that parliamentarians may be politically constrained from expressing. A New Chapter in Immunization Advocacy This historic gathering represents more than just a meeting – it marks the beginning of a powerful parliamentary movement for immunization financing across two continents. By leveraging their unique positions, these parliamentary champions are poised to drive sustainable domestic resource mobilization. This is essential for ensuring that health systems can consistently deliver vaccines, protecting communities year after year, especially as countries transition from donor support. With Gavi having already helped immunize 1.1 billion children since 2000, the stakes and opportunities are clear. Through this new network and their individual country actions, these parliamentarians are not just advocating for budget lines – they’re championing the right of every child to grow up healthy and protected from preventable diseases, building a foundation for a more prosperous future. The Istanbul Call to Action stands as both a commitment and a challenge – to governments, donors and the parliamentarians themselves – to ensure that the life-saving progress made in global immunization is not just maintained but accelerated in the years to come."

Murkomen directed National Government Administration Officers (NGAOs) and the National Police Service (NPS) to launch immediate operations targeting illegal brew dens and apprehend perpetrators. He also flagged the illegal use of counterfeit stamps from the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to endorse adulterated alcohol. “These issues are being dealt with, and the regional and county security teams are on high alert,” said the CS. Speaking during the Lower Eastern Region edition of the Jukwaa la Usalama forum in Machakos, Murkomen said illicit brew and fake alcohol remained a cross-cutting menace that must be urgently addressed. He announced that tougher regulations were underway to stem the sector’s devastating effects. Public engagements during the tour revealed deep frustrations among locals, with some accusing security officers of collusion with rogue traders. In Machakos and Makueni counties, residents called on assistant chiefs and chiefs to act firmly against known brewers who continue to operate with impunity. Murkomen, presiding over the town hall meeting at the Machakos County Commissioner’s residence, emphasised the need for an open and candid conversation on security and service delivery issues. He was joined by Machakos Governor Wavinya Ndeti, her Deputy Francis Mwangangi, Internal Security PS Dr. Raymond Omollo, Eastern Regional Commissioner Paul Rotich, County Commissioner Josephine Ouko, County Assembly Speaker Anne Kiusya, Members of the County Assembly, and senior ministry officials. Locals also urged the government to adopt a multi-agency approach to arrest those behind the distribution of adulterated alcohol."

The high-level peace dialogue, held at El Oadasio Hotel in Rumuruti town, brought together elders, youth leaders, civil society representatives, persons with disabilities (PWDs) and local leaders from both communities. Chaired by Kieni MP Antony Wainaina, the meeting aimed to address deep-rooted causes of violence, including competition over limited natural resources such as grazing land and water, compounded by recurring droughts, overgrazing, and population pressures. “We convened this forum to identify the root causes of the conflict that has led to loss of lives and livelihoods,” said Wainaina. “As a Committee, our core mandate is to promote peaceful coexistence among all communities in the country, and this initiative is a step toward lasting peace.” Discussions revealed that historical grievances, including cattle rustling and land disputes, continue to fuel tensions between the two communities. Leading the NCIC delegation, Commissioner Dorcas Kedogo emphasised the commission’s commitment to fostering dialogue and sustainable peace in conflict-prone regions. Also present were Luanda MP Dick Maungu and Isiolo North MP Joseph Lomwa, who echoed calls for reconciliation and inclusive peacebuilding efforts. “When you see us here, it’s because Parliament is deeply concerned. We are committed to brokering peace,” said Hon. Maungu. Lomwa underscored the critical role of local communities in fostering unity, saying: “The future of our children and women has been severely impacted by these conflicts. It’s time for peace to prevail.” The meeting concluded with a joint call for sustained dialogue, equitable resource sharing, and community-driven peace mechanisms."

The Head of State touched down in the Italian capital early Saturday, ahead of the historic funeral ceremony set to be attended by millions from around the world. President Ruto is among several world leaders who will pay their last respects to the late Pontiff, whose legacy of humility, compassion and commitment to social justice transformed the Catholic Church and inspired global action on issues such as poverty, climate change and peacebuilding. Pope Francis passed away on April 21, 2025, after a decade-long papacy marked by groundbreaking reforms and a tireless pursuit of unity within the church and beyond. His death has triggered an outpouring of grief, with tributes pouring in from across religious, political and social spheres. Speaking before his departure, President Ruto described Pope Francis as “a beacon of hope and a champion of the marginalised,” noting that his teachings transcended religious boundaries and deeply impacted humanity. Kenya, a predominantly Christian nation with a strong Catholic following, has joined the global Catholic community in mourning the Pope’s passing. Special Masses and prayer services have been held across the country in honour of his life and service. Pope Francis will be laid to rest at the Vatican, in a ceremony expected to attract dignitaries, clergy, and faithful from all corners of the globe.

The pastor’s arrest by a multi-agency team followed investigations into his activities at New Foundation Church in Chakama Location, where he is alleged to have been indoctrinating his followers with dangerous teachings. Authorities revealed that congregants were instructed not to seek medical treatment in hospitals when sick. Instead, they were directed to climb a tree within the church compound, believed to be sacred, to receive healing. Additionally, the pastor reportedly administered a substance referred to as maji ya uzima (water of life), which was claimed to have healing powers and sold to followers at Ksh 200 per litre. The water was drawn from a well within the church premises. Preliminary investigations suggest that at least two members of the congregation may have died as a result of these practices, while over 200 others remain at risk if the church’s operations are not promptly addressed. While law enforcement agencies continue to uphold the right to freedom of worship, the public has been cautioned against joining organisations that deviate from sound doctrine and place lives in danger. The court has granted the investigation team 10 days to conclude their inquiries. The case is scheduled for mention on May 5, 2025."
Gov’t urged to invest in youth innovation and growth platforms,https://www.kbc.co.ke/govt-urged-to-invest-in-youth-innovation-and-growth-platforms/,2025-04-26T12:11:08+03:00,"15 billion trees,Dr. Isaac Kalua Green","The government is being challenged to empower young innovators and create platforms that foster growth and financial autonomy among the youth. According to Green Africa Chairperson and conservationist Dr. Isaac Kalua Green, Africa, and Kenya in particular, are brimming with opportunities driven by young innovators who are reshaping the country’s operations and future. Dr. Kalua emphasised the need for increased investment in innovation hubs, noting that today’s youth are more inclined toward autonomy than traditional employment. He said supporting their ideas could open new pathways for Kenya to compete on the global stage. Citing the example of Safaricom’s MPESA, which started as a small idea in 2007 and has since revolutionised mobile money globally, Dr. Kalua pointed out that nurturing local ideas can yield world-changing innovations. MPESA’s success, he noted, came from its early recognition and adoption by Safaricom, which propelled it onto the international stage and inspired countless other innovations. Dr. Kalua added that Kenya’s high youth unemployment rate, currently at 40 per cent, according to the Kenya Bureau of Statistics,  could be addressed by channelling more resources toward youth-led innovations. He urged the government to move away from focusing solely on grand, high-cost solutions and instead support smaller, youth-driven ideas that require minimal investment but have the potential to grow into significant income-generating ventures that could transform the country’s economy. Dr. Kalua made the remarks during the Warriors for Good Awards 2025, where young people and organisations were celebrated for their outstanding contributions to innovation and societal change. During the event, Green Africa was also recognised for its impactful investment in environmental conservation. Additionally, Dr. Kalua challenged the government to rethink its ambitious goal of planting 15 billion trees by 2032. He proposed introducing incentives for individuals who plant and nurture trees, positioning tree planting as an opportunity to tap into the carbon credit market and create new income streams."
32-year-old Mwita eyes IEBC role with youth focus,https://www.kbc.co.ke/32-year-old-mwita-eyes-iebc-role-with-youth-focus/,2025-04-26T11:50:59+03:00,"Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC),Joel Mwita","Joel Mwita could soon become the youngest commissioner at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) if his interview performance is anything to go by. Appearing before the IEBC selection panel on Friday, the 32-year-old candidate placed enhancing voter registration and curbing youth voter apathy at the heart of his mission to transform the electoral agency. “If I get an opportunity to serve as commissioner, I will remove the commission from the Anniversary Towers to the people,” Mwita told the Nelson Makanda-led panel, emphasising the need for constant and open stakeholder engagement to rebuild public trust in IEBC. Mwita, who has over a decade of experience in elections management, governance, and financial management, said youth-specific messaging, programmes, and policies would be key in mobilising young people to register and participate in elections. “I will ensure there is constant engagement with the people, especially the youth population, who are the target group,” he said. A certified mediator with a background in peacebuilding, conflict management, and research, Mwita underscored the need for simpler, accessible voter registration processes. He promised to champion continuous registration efforts, targeting the many eligible Kenyans who are yet to enlist as voters. “As IEBC, we will ensure the process of voter registration is guaranteed and is continuous by reaching out to this target population — those who have not registered — and making the process easy and understandable for them,” he said. Mwita further proposed a close collaboration between IEBC and the National Registration Bureau to fast-track the issuance of national identity cards to youths who have turned 18, especially in border counties where bureaucratic hurdles have disenfranchised thousands. “The youth need to be fed with relevant information, which is very critical for them to understand why they should participate in this important democratic exercise,” he added. Currently serving as the Director of Liaison Services and Head of Nairobi Office for the Turkana County Government, Mwita portrayed himself as a dynamic, innovative youth specialist with strong negotiation and interpersonal skills. Mwita was the last candidate to face the panel and left no doubt that, should he be appointed, his tenure would prioritise getting the youth through the ballot box doors and ensuring the IEBC reconnects with the electorate."
Crowds applaud pope’s coffin as Vatican funeral begins,https://www.kbc.co.ke/crowds-applaud-popes-coffin-as-vatican-funeral-begins/,2025-04-26T11:30:57+03:00,"Holy See,Pope Francis","Tens of thousands of mourners and world leaders including US President Donald Trump packed St Peter’s Square on Saturday for the funeral of Pope Francis, the champion of the poor and the Catholic Church’s first Latin American leader. Some waited overnight to get a seat for the ceremony, with police reporting some 150,000 people in the square and surrounding streets even before proceedings began at 10:00am (0900 GMT). The crowds cheered and applauded as the pope’s coffin was brought out of St Peter’s Basilica into the square. Many of the more than 50 heads of state attending the funeral had entered the Basilica beforehand to pay their respects at the coffin of the Argentine pontiff, who died on Monday aged 88. Guests included Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Britain’s Prince William as well as Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky — who met Trump on the sidelines, according to a Ukrainian spokesperson. Francis sought to steer the centuries-old Church into a more inclusive direction during his 12-year papacy, and his death prompted a global outpouring of emotion. “He was not just the pope, he was what the definition of being human is,” said Andrea Ugalde, 39, who flew from Los Angeles to attend Saturday’s mass. Italian and Vatican authorities have mounted a major security operation for the ceremony, with fighter jets on standby and snipers positioned on roofs surrounding the tiny city state. But the massive crowd was largely silent as they waited, watching proceedings on several large screens around the square. “We spent the whole night here in the car with the children,” said Peruvian Gabriela Lazo, 41. “We are very sorry for what happened to him because we hold a South American pope in our hearts.” The funeral sets off the first of nine days of official Vatican mourning for Francis, who took over following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. After the mourning, cardinals will gather for the conclave to elect a new pope to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.

– Diplomatic gathering –
Many of Francis’s reforms angered traditionalists, while his criticism of injustices, from the treatment of migrants to the damage wrought by global warming, riled many world leaders. Yet the former archbishop of Buenos Aires’s compassion and charisma earned him global affection and respect. Trump’s administration drew the pontiff’s ire for its mass deportation of migrants, but the president arrived late on Friday with his wife Melania to pay tribute to “a good man” who “loved the world”. Making the first foreign trip of his second term, Trump was alongside dozens of leaders from other countries keen to bend his ear over a trade war he unleashed, among other subjects. Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden also attended the funeral, alongside UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Lebanon’s Joseph Aoun. Israel — angered by Francis’s criticism of its conduct in Gaza — was sending only its Holy See ambassador. China, which does not have formal relations with the Vatican, did not send any representative at all. – Simple tomb –
Francis died of a stroke and heart failure less than a month after he left hospital where he had battled pneumonia for five weeks. He loved nothing more than being among his flock, taking selfies with the faithful and kissing babies, and made it his mission to visit the peripheries, rather than mainstream centres of Catholicism. His last public act, the day before his death, was an Easter Sunday blessing of the entire world, ending his papacy as he had begun it — with an appeal to protect the “vulnerable, the marginalised and migrants”. The Jesuit chose to be named after Saint Francis of Assisi, saying he wanted “a poor Church for the poor”, and eschewed fine robes and the papal palace. Instead, the Church’s 266th pope lived at a Vatican guesthouse and chose to be interred in his favourite Rome church, Santa Maria Maggiore — the first pontiff to be buried outside the Vatican walls in more than a century. His send-off is grand affair, featuring some 224 cardinals and 750 bishops and priests alongside world dignitaries. Catholics around the world are holding events to watch the proceedings live, including in Buenos Aires. “The pope showed us that there was another way to live the faith,” said Lara Amado, 25. But the humble pope asked to be put inside a single wooden coffin to be laid in a simple marble tomb. After the funeral, the coffin will be taken to the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica via the Fori Imperiali — where Rome’s ancient temples lie — and the Colosseum. A group of “poor and needy” will greet the hearse on its arrival, the Vatican said. – Refusal to judge –
Francis’s admirers credit him with transforming perceptions of the Church and helping revive the faith following decades of clerical sex abuse scandals. He was considered a radical by some for allowing divorced believers to receive communion, approving the baptism of transgender believers and blessings for same-sex couples, and refusing to judge gay Catholics. But he also stuck with some centuries-old dogma, notably holding firm on the Church’s opposition to abortion. The first trip of Francis’s papacy was to Lampedusa, an Italian island that is often the first port of call for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, and he visited Greece’s Lesbos island, flying 12 refugees home with him. Some of those refugees are attending his funeral."
Baringo MPs urged to ‘talk to youth before guns do’ amid rising insecurity,https://www.kbc.co.ke/baringo-mps-urged-to-talk-to-youth-before-guns-do-amid-rising-insecurity/,2025-04-26T09:52:57+03:00,"Baringo MP,Insecurity","Baringo Members of Parliament have been urged to use the ongoing parliamentary recess to spearhead peace efforts in their constituencies amid rising insecurity in the region. National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula made the appeal during an afternoon sitting in Parliament, emphasising that elected leaders must take a frontline role in disarming and engaging youth who have been linked to illegal firearms and banditry. “These are the young men who vote for you. Go and meet them, talk to them,” said Wetang’ula. “Encourage them to stop wielding illegal firearms so that, as leaders, you also play your role to ensure there is peace within your jurisdiction.” He specifically addressed MPs Reuben Kiborek (Mogotio), Joseph Makilap (Baringo North), William Kamket (Tiaty), Musa Sirma (Eldama Ravine), Florence Jematia (County MP), Joshua Kandie (Baringo Central) and Charles Kamuren (Baringo South), urging them to reconnect with their communities during the break. Wetang’ula praised the Administration and National Security Committee for their detailed report on insecurity in six counties, noting that while relative calm had returned to places like Turkana, Samburu, Isiolo, and Marsabit, Baringo remained a hotspot. “Currently, the area that is experiencing a lot of problems is Baringo,” noted committee Vice Chair Dido Raso. “We will be able to give a report to the House immediately after the recess.” The Speaker particularly challenged younger legislators, such as Kiborek, to use their relatability and influence to reach youth more effectively than their older colleagues. “Your access to them is better than probably Musa Sirma’s and others’. Don’t wait for the police to come from Nairobi—you can also play your part,” Wetang’ula urged. In a firm response, Sirma assured the House that Baringo leaders were committed to resolving the conflict. “On behalf of all the members, those present and those not, we shall endeavour to clean up what is the mess within Baringo,” he said. Wetang’ula concluded by insisting that all leaders, including those not present, must be included in the grassroots peacebuilding process. “Don’t leave anyone behind,” he said, in a final call for collective action. As insecurity continues to affect Kenya’s northern belt, the Speaker’s directive signals a shift toward locally led peace interventions, placing the burden of change squarely on the shoulders of elected leaders."

Canada votes in election upended by Trump threats,https://www.kbc.co.ke/canada-votes-in-election-upended-by-trump-threats/,2025-04-26T09:34:24+03:00,"Canada,Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney","Canada will hold an election Monday following a campaign electrified by US President Donald Trump’s threats, with Prime Minister Mark Carney favored to win after promising voters he has the experience to stand up to the United States. A victory for Carney’s Liberal Party would mark one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history. On January 6, the day former prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his plans to resign, his Liberals trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points in most polls, and Tory leader Pierre Poilievre looked certain to be Canada’s next premier. Over the following weeks, Trump chaotically rolled out his trade war while repeatedly talking about absorbing Canada into the United States. Outraged Canadians booed the American anthem at sporting events and cancelled US travel plans. When Carney replaced the unpopular Trudeau on March 14, he anchored his message squarely on the Trump threat, claiming the US “wants to break us, so they can own us.” The 60-year-old, who has never held elected office but led the central banks of Canada and Britain, assured voters his global financial experience made him the ideal candidate to defend Canada against Trump’s volatile tariff campaign. “Pierre Poilievre has no plan to stand up to President Trump,” Carney said Friday. “Unlike Pierre Poilievre, I’ve managed budgets before. I’ve managed economies before, I’ve managed crises before. This is a time for experience, not experiments,” he added. Trump’s impact and the Trudeau-for-Carney swap unsettled Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades. But the Conservative leader has tried to keep attention on issues that drove anger towards the Liberals during Trudeau’s decade in power, particularly rising living costs. “The trajectory we are on after this lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair,” he said Thursday. He has also criticized Trump, but blamed poor economic performance under the Liberals for leaving Canada vulnerable to US protectionism. Analysts say his political style, notably his fondness for bombastic partisan attacks, has also hurt him with voters who may have been inclined to vote Tory, including women.

– Tightening race? –
Polls project a Liberal government, but the race has tightened in its final days. The public broadcaster CBC’s poll aggregator has at various points given the Liberals a seven-to-eight point national lead, but on Friday it put Liberal support at 42 percent, with the Tories at 38. A crucial factor that could help the Liberals is the sagging numbers for the left-wing New Democrats and the Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois. In past elections, stronger support for those parties has curbed Liberal seat tallies in the key provinces of Ontario and Quebec. A record 7.3 million of Canada’s 28.9 million eligible voters cast advanced ballots over the Easter weekend, a 25 percent increase compared to advanced voting in 2021. Montreal voter Nathalie Tremblay told AFP this election is “definitely more important” than past elections because of “everything that is happening in the United States.” “I think everyone is concerned,” she said, voicing hope “a strong government” is in place after Monday. Simon-Pierre Lepine told AFP he was worried about “ten more years of backtracking” under the Liberals, who he accused of plunging the country “into a financial hole.” The 49-year-old entrepreneur said he believes “the Conservatives traditionally do much better” in managing the economy.

– ‘A strange campaign’ –
For McGill University political scientist Daniel Beland, Conservative efforts to “change the subject of the campaign” away from Trump have largely failed. Tim Powers, a political analyst, agreed the campaign is not the one the Tories wanted to run. They had hoped “there’d be more of a debate around affordability and all of the things that they were scoring points on,” he said, adding Poilievre “envisioned a campaign where Justin Trudeau would be his opponent.” But he said it’s been “a strange campaign,” full of surprises and the Tories will make a final weekend push to turn out their vote. The winner should be known hours after polls close on Monday."

The Argentine pontiff, who died on Monday aged 88, sought to steer the centuries-old Church into a more inclusive direction during his 12-year papacy. Some 250,000 people paid their respects before his coffin during its three days of lying in state at St Peter’s Basilica, and huge numbers gathered from dawn on Friday to attend his final send-off. “He was not just the pope, he was what the definition of being human is,” said Andrea Ugalde, 39, who flew from Los Angeles to attend Saturday’s mass.

Acting on a tip-off from members of the public, a multi-agency team comprising officers from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), local administration and the National Police Service raided the premises located along Isiolo 2nd South Avenue. Two suspects were arrested during the operation, while the main suspect, who had rented the house from a widow, escaped and is currently being pursued by authorities. Ruiru Sub-County Police Commander Charles Kibathi said the suspects were caught in the act, with distilling and packaging activities ongoing on the ground floor of the lavish two-storey home. The owner, according to police, had leased the house and relocated to her rural home, unaware of the illegal business. During the raid, officers recovered 10,000 empty bottles, 126 cartons of alcohol, KRA stamps, distilling equipment, several water tanks and bottle tops. All exhibits were transported to KRA warehouses in Nairobi for further investigations. Kahawa Sukari Welfare Association Chairman Samuel Mwaniki said the suspect had rented the premises in December last year. He noted that this was not the first time such an illegal liquor operation had been uncovered in the estate and urged residents to report suspicious activities to authorities. “This has become a recurring problem. We must work together to protect our youth and ensure our estate remains safe,” Mwaniki said. Area MCA Kennedy Odhiambo condemned the operation, noting that the business was unlicensed and operating in total disregard of Kiambu County laws. He urged landlords to vet their tenants and share lease details with local security and administrative officers. Ruiru Deputy County Commissioner Julius Too affirmed the government’s resolve to stamp out illegal distilleries, especially those operating in residential areas. “We will not allow such illegal businesses to thrive in our neighbourhoods. Preliminary investigations show the main suspect has been involved in similar operations in other locations,” Too said."
Three sentenced as Kenya cracks down on wildlife trafficking,https://www.kbc.co.ke/three-sentenced-as-kenya-cracks-down-on-wildlife-trafficking/,2025-04-26T11:46:12+03:00,"wildlife conservation.,wildlife trafficking","Three suspects have been sentenced, and several others have been charged in a major breakthrough against wildlife trafficking, as the JKIA Law Courts in Nairobi handled three high-profile cases involving elephant tusks, rhino horn, and aloe gum. In one of the rulings, two men, Moriati Ole Kimore and Lepapa Saruni, were sentenced to five years in prison for illegal possession of four elephant tusks worth KSh 2.49 million. The duo was arrested in the Ntarara area of Kajiado South on August 28, 2024, while ferrying 24.9 kilograms of ivory on a motorcycle. Their arrest followed a joint sting operation by a multi-agency serious crimes unit. The court granted them 14 days to appeal the sentence. In a separate case, the court denied bail to Mohamed Salah Mustafa, who was arrested in Moyale town with 2.6 kilograms of black rhino horn concealed in a woven bag. Prosecutors opposed his release, citing his unknown residence and flight risk. A pre-bail report will be tabled in court on April 28. Forensic experts from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) confirmed the rhino horn was equivalent to one slaughtered black rhino, a critically endangered species with fewer than 1,000 individuals left in Kenya. DNA analysis is underway to trace the origin of the horn, and Interpol has been alerted to possible transnational links. In the third case, three suspects, Adan Adaw Abdullah, Ahmed Yusuf Abdul Rahman and Chonde Cheme Chonde, were charged with trafficking 15 tonnes of aloe gum worth KSh 15 million. The illegal consignment was intercepted on April 13 at the Merti-Junction roadblock in Samburu County during a police operation. The suspects were released on KSh 500,000 bail each, with their pre-trial set for April 29. “These rulings mark a strong statement against illegal wildlife trade and environmental crime,” said a KWS spokesperson. “We urge Kenyans to stay alert and report any suspicious activities through our toll-free hotline.” The trafficking of wildlife products, including aloe gum, ivory, and rhino horn, is punishable under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act and violates international treaties such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Kenya continues to lead the region in tough legal action against wildlife crimes, with authorities promising more coordinated crackdowns in the coming months."

Organized by the Chongqing Luhai International Communication Foundation and the Asia-America-Europe Cultural Exchange Center of Chongqing, with support from the Chongqing Luhai Foundation International Volunteer Service Special Fund, the initiative aimed to foster cross-cultural understanding and environmental cooperation between Chinese and African youth. A shared vision for conservation The journey began at the Kenya National Museum, where the students explored the country’s rich biodiversity through exhibits and specimens. Li Xincan, a sixth-grader from Honghe Primary School in Chongqing’s Yongchuan District, expressed awe at Africa’s wildlife, “Seeing the African elephant specimens made me realize how majestic they are—much larger than Asian elephants!” The group later visited the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) headquarters in Nairobi, gaining insights into global environmental policies and collaborative conservation efforts. Cultural exchange and joint advocacy A highlight of the trip was the “Land-Sea Promise: China-Africa Ecological Civilization Exchange” event at the University of Nairobi Confucius Institute. Chongqing students took active roles. Li Meile, a student from Xiamen University Malaysia, curated a photo exhibition titled “Eagle City”, showcasing Chongqing’s raptor conservation efforts. Meanwhile, Yang Yunqiao, a middle school student from Chongqing Railway Middle School, interviewed international guests on ecological protection and similarities between China and Africa. The young delegates also co-authored the “China-Africa Youth Eco-Friendly Initiative”, pledging to promote sustainable practices. Jin Shishuang, a Kenyan student at the Confucius Institute, said, “This isn’t just a visit—it’s the start of long-term collaboration between our youth.” In Masai Mara, the volunteers engaged with local students, sharing stories of Chongqing’s biodiversity through symbolic “Eagle City” badges. Gifts were exchanged, and Kenyan community leader Simon Masago welcomed further cooperation, “We’d love more Chinese volunteers to join projects like building fences, planting gardens, and improving livelihoods.” A step toward global sustainability Li Hui, Director of the Asia-America-Europe Cultural Exchange Center, emphasized the program’s broader mission, “We want youth to connect deeply—not just culturally, but heart-to-heart.” This inaugural trip under the “Land-Sea International Volunteer Service” project is set to expand, with more exchanges planned across Africa. Chen Can, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chongqing Luhai International Communication Foundation, added, “True international service means immersing in local communities. We’ll keep empowering youth to learn, grow, and contribute to global sustainable development.” As these young ambassadors return home, their experiences stand as a testament to the power of cross-border collaboration in safeguarding our planet’s future."

MPs raise alarm over child labour in Kilifi’s herders-farmers conflict,https://www.kbc.co.ke/mps-raise-alarm-over-child-labour-in-kilifis-herders-farmers-conflict/,2025-04-25T19:53:37+03:00,"Child Labour,Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunities","A Parliamentary Committee has raised concern over the increasing number of underage children being hired as herders in parts of Kilifi County. The National Assembly Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunities expressed shock during a recent peace meeting, following revelations that prominent farmers in Magarini and Malindi constituencies were employing children as herders, depriving them of education. Committee Chairperson Adan Yussuf Haji urged security agencies to take action against individuals who undermine children’s future by hiring them for cheap labour. “Police and administrators must act swiftly and hold accountable those who exploit underage children as herders, thereby destroying their lives,” said the Mandera West MP. He added, “The days when children were used to graze livestock are long gone. Anyone denying children their right to education should face the full force of the law.” MP Haji made the remarks during a community dialogue meeting organized by the Committee in partnership with the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC). The meeting was aimed at fostering peace between warring herders and farmers in Magarini Constituency. The meeting also sought long-term solutions to ongoing conflicts between the two groups, which have led to loss of lives and destruction of property. Farmers, led by former MCA Renson Karisa, lamented the destruction of food crops caused by herders who reportedly drive hundreds of cattle, camels, and goats onto their farms with impunity. They revealed that most of the herders are children aged between 12 and 15 years. Karisa claimed that powerful government officials who own the destructive livestock intimidate residents who attempt to raise complaints. “When we report such cases, the police and chiefs fail to act because they fear repercussions, as the livestock often belong to influential figures in government,” said Karisa. He further alleged that farmers have been attacked, some fatally, during confrontations with herders trespassing on their land. “I was assaulted and suffered a broken leg after confronting herders who had driven nearly 300 camels into my farm,” he recounted, adding that the herders are usually armed with crude weapons such as bows, arrows, knives, and pangas. Former area MP Harrison Kombe noted that conflict between herders and farmers remains prevalent in Chamari, Malafa and Bungari areas. “We successfully brokered peace in Marereni, which had similar challenges,” he said. Japheth Gona, Chairperson of a local Community Policing Committee, told the meeting that the use of child herders is on the rise. He described the children as illiterate and defiant. “They don’t understand Kiswahili or the local language, and they act with impunity,” he said. Teso North MP Oku Kaunya urged residents to share information with the Committee discreetly if they fear reprisals. “We’re here to find a lasting solution. If you have any information and fear speaking publicly, feel free to share it confidentially,” he said. Lamu County MP Monica Marubu condemned the use of children as herders and called for urgent intervention. “I am deeply disturbed by reports that children are being hired to herd cattle at the expense of their education. Security agencies must address this issue swiftly,” she said. Shinyalu MP Fred Ikana called on both herders and farmers to respect each other’s property and foster peaceful coexistence for the region’s sustainable development. NCIC Commissioner Dr. Danvas Makori and CEO Dr. Daniel Mutegi Giti emphasized that the meeting was part of a broader conflict resolution program. “We will return for a follow-up meeting with concrete solutions,” said Dr. Makori, urging residents to live in harmony. Magarini Division Assistant County Commissioner Joshua Leitoi confirmed that authorities are addressing the exploitation of children as herders. He said several herders have been prosecuted for property destruction, and some farmers have faced assault charges.

The call was made during a peace forum held in Rumuruti, Laikipia County, which brought together various stakeholders including officials from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), national government administrators, police officers, peace committees, elders from the Samburu and Turkana communities, and members of the Parliamentary Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunities. Speaking at the forum, youth representative Ewoi Abura from Baragoi emphasized the need to curb the misuse of social media by young people to fuel conflict. He noted that posting content that glorifies inter-communal killings or livestock theft undermines peace building efforts. Elders Wilfred Marti from the Turkana community and Thomas Lemedero, a retired senior chief from Baragoi Sub-County, underscored the importance of local initiatives in promoting peace. They stressed that it is the responsibility of Samburu residents, particularly elders, to lead peace building efforts. However, Dorcas Leakono from Baragoi pointed out the need for the redeployment of a special security force in Samburu. She noted that the county had enjoyed relative peace during the two years the special force had been stationed in the area. Samburu Central Deputy County Commissioner Titus Omanyi, representing the County Commissioner, said the forum attendees had been carefully selected as peace ambassadors. They are expected to return to their communities and actively participate in efforts to end violence and livestock theft. Triza Nairote Enae from Impact said the forum aimed to develop practical solutions to the persistent conflict in Samburu County. Kieni MP and Parliamentary Committee member Njoroge Wainaina called on the warring Samburu and Turkana communities to abandon outdated cultural practices that continue to fuel conflict. He was accompanied by fellow committee member, Isiolo North MP Lomwa Joseph Samal. NCIC Commissioner Dorcas Kedogo emphasized the importance of sensitizing the two communities on the value of peace and the sanctity of life.END"

Wahome issues title deeds in Tana River’s Kipini Settlement Scheme,https://www.kbc.co.ke/wahome-issues-title-deeds-in-tana-rivers-kipini-settlement-scheme/,2025-04-25T19:07:57+03:00,,"Cabinet Secretary for Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development Alice Wahome, today issued 1,283 title deeds to residents of Kipini East Ward in Tana River County. The event, held in Kipini town, marked a significant milestone for the 7000 acre Kipini Settlement Scheme. The land, bought by the Government from Nairobi Ranch, has 1,283 individual plots, including 32 earmarked for public utilities. In her address, the Cabinet Secretary urged residents to value the land ownership documents and make informed decisions regarding their use. “When you get your title, I urge you to do family consultation—don’t be in a hurry to sell the land,” she said. She also issued 17 community land title deeds, the first of their kind in the Coast region. The CS called on both national and county leaders to support the registration of unregistered community lands by submitting comprehensive inventories and countering misinformation surrounding the process. “As leaders, we must play a more active role in facilitating this registration. This is about securing livelihoods, heritage, and development for communities,” she stated. Wahome also announced plans for the construction of a modern market in Kipini under the Kenya Urban Support Program, aimed at supporting local economic activity, particularly the thriving fish trade. She was accompanied by Secretary for Administration in the State Department for Lands and Physical Planning Mohamed Maalim, Chief Land Registrar David Nyandoro, and other senior officers from the Ministry. Garsen MP Ali Wario welcomed the move, saying, “Kipini people have benefited in a big way. The title deeds will help resolve longstanding land disputes, many of which have been aggravated by politics. I urge the government to ensure a market is built to support the local economy.” Tana River Senator Danson Mungatana echoed the sentiments, stating, “We are happy to have our titles today. Now we are truly entitled to our country. We’ve waited many years. We are committed to ensuring all remaining titles are issued. Any arising issues will be addressed.” Besides the issuance event, the State Department for Lands and Physical Planning has outlined several initiatives for the County, including the planned purchase of 5,000 acres each in Kibusu and Kon Dertu for the resettlement of flood victims. At the national level, the Department has issued over 223,000 title deeds in the current financial year alone, and more than 1 million since the current administration took office, Additionally, full digitization of land records has been achieved in Nairobi and Murang’a through the Ardhisasa platform, with digitization work continuing in Mombasa, Isiolo, and Marsabit. The Department has also generated over Ksh13 billion in revenue this year, an achievement driven by digitization, the integration of ArdhiPay with the national eCitizen platform and management reforms. The department emerged in the lead position in a recent ranking of State Departments in terms of All-time Transactions on the eCitizen platform."
Kenya losing Ksh. 900 billion annually to climate change impacts – Dr. Kalua Green,https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-losing-ksh-900-billion-annually-to-climate-change-impacts-dr-kalua-green/,2025-04-25T19:00:43+03:00,,"An environmentalist has raised the alarm, warning that the country’s economy faces a bleak future if immediate and sustained efforts are not made to combat climate change. According to Dr. Kalua Green, a renowned environmentalist and ecopreneur, failure to find solutions to extreme weather events and environmental degradation could lead to significant economic disruptions across various sectors. Speaking at the launch of the Institute for Sustainability and Climate under the International Leadership University, Dr. Green indicated that Kenya is already losing approximately 3 to 5% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to climate change. “The bleed on the economy and its entire output costs us about Ksh. 870 billion annually. This is strictly due to climate change. It encompasses the costs of floods, droughts, failed harvests, lost jobs, and damaged infrastructure,” he said. This trend is likely to persist and result in greater costs for Kenyans if urgent action is not taken. Government and institutions of higher learning are now being called upon to collaborate and develop courses that could change this trajectory and avert a potential catastrophe. “If over the next 15 years nothing is done and nothing changes, we are looking at a loss of Ksh. 15 trillion. This amount is sufficient to transform our entire nation. These are not just numbers; they represent our schools, hospitals, farms, and futures. Climate change is not a luxury,” Dr. Green warned. He further argued that President William Ruto’s vision of making Kenya an environmental hub and his goal of planting 15 billion trees by 2032 may not materialize if Kenyan institutions of higher learning do not take the lead. “Most of our universities are a total mess. The ones you would expect to have everything needed to take this country to the next level have forgotten that we are in a time of crisis. Leaders are fighting in courts one after another because of other interests,” lamented Dr. Green. He noted that Kenya and Africa, in general, have the capability to lead the world in developing solutions to reverse the adverse effects of climate change, emphasizing that they are the most affected and that collaboration is essential, particularly from institutions of higher learning. Consequently, Kenyans have been urged to take the quest to protect and preserve the environment seriously, as there are significant consequences to neglecting this responsibility. President Ruto has been a strong advocate for conservation efforts, introducing annual tree planting days. Institutions of higher learning are now being challenged to devise solutions that will give the country a competitive edge in environmental conservation and allow it to benefit from carbon credits."

Bishop Lagho highlighted the pontiff’s advocacy for immigrants, reminding leaders that nations were built by immigrants, often under the harsh realities of slavery. He urged Kenyan leaders to emulate Pope Francis’s commitment to the downtrodden, especially as the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen in Kenya. Rev. Paul Mutunga, Chairman of the Interfaith Council in Malindi, praised the gathering of diverse faiths to mourn a leader of great integrity. He emphasized the importance of humility in leadership, urging leaders to fulfill their divine purpose without oppressing those they serve. Joseph Karisa Mwarandu, representing the Traditional African Religion, lauded Pope Francis’s efforts to unite humanity and uplift the marginalized. He recalled the pontiff’s visit to Kenya, where he gave hope to those in low-income communities, affirming their worth. Sheikh Farhan Abdikadir Mohamed of the Programmes Secretary in the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya (CIPK), Malindi, described the loss as profound for society and religious leaders worldwide. He called for emulating Pope Francis’s example to benefit humanity both in this life and beyond. On his part, Sheikh Masoud Omar Masoud, Secretary of CIPK Malindi, expressed gratitude to Bishop Lagho for fostering unity among religious leaders in the diocese. The leaders concluded the mass by signing a condolence book placed at the cathedral entrance, marking their collective respect for a leader who transcended religious boundaries to serve humanity."

The day’s activities commenced with a visit to the headquarters of Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL) in Ningde City. During this visit, President Ruto acknowledged the company’s global leadership in electric vehicle battery manufacturing, achieved in just over a decade. CATL’s innovative applications in green energy have transformed motor transport, empowered thousands of enterprises with electrification solutions, and contributed to a reduction in carbon emissions. Following this, President Ruto visited the Ningde Poverty Alleviation Exhibition Hall, which serves as a model for poverty reduction efforts. “This is a clear demonstration of the possibilities that can be achieved through modernization through coordination and synergy in leadership,” he stated during a media address at the end of the tour. The President praised the vision and determination of Ningde’s past and present leaders, including President Xi Jinping, for lifting the hilly metropolis out of poverty within a generation. President Xi is credited with significantly transforming Ningde’s fortunes during his tenure as a young administrator in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His experiences in Ningde City are believed to have greatly influenced his book, “Xi Jinping Thoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.” President Ruto also visited the exhibition marking the 30th Anniversary of Xi Jinping’s “Vision 3820” Strategic Plan for Fuzhou City. This exhibition highlights President Xi’s model of social democracy, which has lifted millions out of poverty in China. By integrating economic growth, social transformation, and environmental conservation, this model has fostered inclusive development for the people of China. Later, he toured the Fujian Academy of Building Research, a scientific innovation institution under the Fujian Construction Investment Group (FCIC) in Fuzhou. FCIC has successfully completed significant construction projects in Kenya, including the Turbi-Moyale Road in Marsabit and the Central Bank of Kenya Pension Fund office block. President Ruto concluded his visit to China with a tour of the Three Lanes and Seven Alleys Historic District in Fuzhou, which preserves and showcases the country’s cultural heritage from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. He was accompanied by First Lady Mama Rachel Ruto, Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya’s envoy to China Willy Bett, and China’s ambassador to Kenya Guo Haiyan."
Thyroid Disease: National awareness campaign launched,https://www.kbc.co.ke/thyroid-disease-national-awareness-campaign-launched/,2025-04-25T18:24:07+03:00,,"Players in the health sector have been urged to amplify the awareness campaign about Thyroid disease in an effort to educate the public about the prevalence and risks associated with thyroid disorders, which often go undiagnosed due to their subtle symptoms. Dr. Roselyn Ngugi, Chair of the Kenya Diabetes Study Group, spoke at the launch of the Thyroid Africa awareness campaign in Nairobi. She announced that the campaign will provide free screening services across counties to facilitate early detection and management of thyroid conditions. “Thyroid disease should be included in the category of non-communicable diseases for it to receive appropriate attention from the government,” she said. Thyroid disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the function of the thyroid gland—a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck, just below the Adam’s apple. Symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, depression, slow heart rate, constipation, dry skin, and memory problems. “While there’s scare data on the disease burden there’s is need for government, researchers and health practitioners collaboration to come up with the prevalence of the disease among the population,” stated Dr. Ngugi.  According to global health statistics, thyroid disorders affect up to 10 percent of the population, with women being disproportionately affected. In Kenya, limited public knowledge, stigma, and a lack of diagnostic facilities have contributed to underreporting and misdiagnosis. The Kenya Diabetes Study Group, Merck Pharmaceuticals, and Thyroid Africa have partnered to launch a nationwide campaign aimed at raising awareness about thyroid diseases and providing free screening services across all counties in Kenya. Joan, a patient diagnosed with the disease, has managed her condition through medication. Stakeholders believe that these awareness campaigns will help inform future policy and healthcare planning. “The government should invest in modern day laboratories to test the disease since private labs charges are expensive,” Joan stated."
Kenyatta eulogizes Pope Francis as exemplar of servant leadership,https://www.kbc.co.ke/rtd-president-uhuru-kenyatta-eulogizes-pope-francis-as-exemplar-of-servant-leadership/,2025-04-25T18:13:03+03:00,"Former President Uhuru Kenyatta,Pope Francis","Former President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogized Pope Francis as a true example of servant leadership. Speaking Friday when he joined the faithful at a requiem Mass of the late His Holiness Pope Francis at Holy Family Basilica in Nairobi County, Kenyatta remarked that late Pope was truly a man who walked in the path of giving dignity to human life, regardless of whichever position one found themselves in. “The Pope chose to serve and not to be served. He was truly a man who walked in the path of giving dignity to human life, regardless of whichever position one found themselves in,” he said. The Mass was organized in collaboration with the Apostolic Nunciature and the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, commemorated the pontiff’s pastoral witness and enduring legacy and was conducted by the Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya, Bert Van Megen. Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at 7:35, at the age of 88, at his residence in the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta. His demise was announced by Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, the Vatican camerlengo. “Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.” said Cardinal Kevin Ferrell The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from a bout of bronchitis for several days. Pope Francis’ clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18. After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery. In 1957, in his early 20s, Jorge Mario Bergoglio underwent surgery in his native Argentina to remove a portion of his lung that had been affected by a severe respiratory infection. As he aged, Pope Francis frequently suffered bouts of respiratory illnesses, even cancelling a planned visit to the United Arab Emirates in November 2023 due to influenza and lung inflammation. In April 2024, the late Pope Francis approved an updated edition of the liturgical book for papal funeral rites, which will guide the funeral Mass which has yet to be announced. The second edition of the Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis introduces several new elements, including how the Pope’s mortal remains are to be handled after death. The ascertainment of death takes place in the chapel, rather than in the room where he died, and his body is immediately placed inside the coffin. According to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, Master of Apostolic Ceremonies, the late Pope Francis had requested that the funeral rites be simplified and focused on expressing the faith of the Church in the Risen Body of Christ. “The renewed rite,” said Archbishop Ravelli, “seeks to emphasise even more that the funeral of the Roman Pontiff is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful person of this world.” Friday’s mass was also attended by Chief Justice Martha Koome, former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, among other national leaders.    Also read https://www.kbc.co.ke/details-of-pope-francis-interment/"
Governors back CS Duale’s push for TaifaCare,https://www.kbc.co.ke/governors-back-cs-duales-push-for-taifacare/,2025-04-26T19:40:31+03:00,"Council of Governors (COG),Health CS Aden Duale","The Council of Governors (CoG) Vice-Chairman, Mutahi Kahiga, has lauded Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Aden Duale for his swift efforts and commitment toward transforming Kenya’s health sector. Speaking at the signing of the Intergovernmental Participatory Agreement (IPA), Governor Kahiga noted that CS Duale has made significant strides in fostering collaboration between the Ministry of Health and county governments since taking office three weeks ago. He asked President William Ruto to retain the health CS at Afya House for continuity and smooth implementation of the government’s Universal Health Coverage transformation agenda. “We have observed CS Duale’s dedication to realising the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) dream during our engagements over this short period. It is clear he is fully committed to ensuring this country achieves the long-overdue goal of quality healthcare for all,” Governor Kahiga said. He called on Kenyans to support the strengthened partnership between the national government and the CoG by registering with the newly established Social Health Authority (SHA) under the Taifa Care program. “My rallying call to all Kenyans is to register as required so that we can collectively achieve this Kenyan dream,” Kahiga added. He further pledged CoG’s full support, led by Chairman Governor Ahmed Abdullahi, for the implementation of the IPA signed between the Ministry of Health and the 47 devolved units. The IPA paves the way for a coordinated rollout of health sector reforms under Taifa Care. In his remarks, Health CS Aden Duale reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to strengthening partnerships with county governments, the public, and all stakeholders in the health sector. Highlighting the importance of devolution in implementing key government policies such as Taifa Care, the Digital Health System (DHS) and the Social Health Authority (SHA), Duale emphasised the need for mutual cooperation between the two levels of government. He underscored the critical role that counties will play in the health sector’s digitisation, noting that close collaboration is vital to delivering affordable, equitable, and efficient healthcare services to all Kenyans. As part of the reforms, the national and county governments signed 10 agreements, including a plan to digitise all public health facilities across the country. The initiative will see the distribution of 74,000 computers and tablets to healthcare workers in all 47 counties and national referral hospitals. “I reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to deepening partnerships with public, private, and other stakeholders in delivering accessible and quality healthcare,” said Duale. Emphasising the role of devolution in health service delivery, he called for continued collaboration between the Ministry and county governments to actualise the government’s health transformation agenda. As part of the IPA, health workers in all public facilities will be trained on digitisation to ensure the smooth rollout of Taifa Care. The plan also includes the development of 315 Smart Primary Care Networks and the establishment of a dynamic, highly available, and fault-tolerant, standards-based Health Information Exchange (HIE). The Health Information Exchange is expected to provide centralised services and registries to facilitate the implementation of national health information systems. Additionally, the Ministry and the CoG agreed to build and maintain an Electronic Health Insurance Claims Platform for all public facilities and to implement a Pharmaceutical Information System and a Logistics Management Information System (Track and Trace System). This is expected to increase accountability and availability of medical supplies and medicines in all health facilities. They also agreed to implement a drug order management system to enable public health facilities to order drugs and consumables online from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA). In addition, they agreed to implement a national Emergency Response Service Platform, which will allow emergency data to be securely shared and enable Kenyans to request ambulances from the comfort of their phones. The Ministry and the CoG further agreed to roll out a national telemedicine platform that will allow citizens to book appointments, access their personal health records and receive virtual consultations, placing them at the centre of the healthcare ecosystem. “We have unanimously agreed that the Ministry of Health and the counties shall strengthen their engagement in preparation for the rollout at the sub-national level,” said Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, who also serves as the Vice-Chairman of the CoG Kahiga explained that the initiative aims to enhance the country’s capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies at the county level. He added that counties would expedite the release of nominated personnel for training on health digitisation. “The assistive devices should be dispatched from the warehouses within two weeks,” Governor Kahiga said. Technical teams from both the Council of Governors and the Ministry of Health have been tasked with finalising the inspection report to facilitate the approval and operationalisation of the national distribution plan."
