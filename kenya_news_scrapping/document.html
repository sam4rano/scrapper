    On Tuesday, September 4, the inaugural
    <a href="https://africaclimatesummit.org/">Africa Climate Summit (ACS)</a>
    kicked off at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi,
    organised by the Kenyan government and the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a>.
    During the summit, African leaders in attendance agreed to lead the way in
    finding sustainable solutions to the climate crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The leaders who were present at the summit included Samia Suluhu (Tanzania),
    Paul Kagame (Rwanda), Évariste Ndayishimiye (Burundi), Filipe Nyusi
    (Mozambique), Salva Kiir (South Sudan), Sassou Nguesso (Congo), Mostafa
    Madbouly (Egypt), Nana Akufo-Addo (Ghana), Mohamed Younis Menfi (Libya),
    Julius Maada (Sierra Leone), Sahle-Work Zewde (Ethiopia), Brahim Ghali
    (Sahrawi), Azali Assoumani (Comoros), Ismaïl Omar Guelleh (Djibouti), Isaias
    Afwerki (Eritrea) and Macky Sall (Senegal) along with the host, Kenya's
    President William Ruto<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>

    Africa is no stranger to the devastating impacts of climate change. From
    prolonged droughts to erratic weather patterns to the displacement of

    >, the continent has been grappling with the consequences of climate change.
    In fact, during the summit, President Ruto noted in his
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEzbow36H8Y">opening speech</a>
    that Africa, despite being a mild contributor to pollution, is experiencing
    the most severe impacts of global warming. During the summit, Afrobarometer,
    a research organization,

      >presented findings from surveys conducted in 36 African countries</a
    >, revealing that a majority of citizens demand urgent government action on
    climate change. However, only 52 percent of those polled were aware of
    climate change, with awareness varying across countries. Among those aware,
    most believe that climate change is making their lives worse, particularly
    in Madagascar, Lesotho, Mauritius, Malawi, and Benin. The urgency of the
    situation is undeniable, and the Africa Climate Summit is a testament to the
    commitment of African nations to address this crisis head-on.
